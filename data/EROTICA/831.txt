Prologue

This is a true story that occupied five years of my life and  significently
changed  me  and those that I touch.  Linda came into my life in August of 1979
and we spent the next five years together.  When we met she was a very naive 20
year old.  I was a very cynical and bitter 35 year old.
I  had	recently  been	separated  from the  U.S. Army as a Captain after 6
years,	8 months and 14 days of service - most of that in South  East  Asia.  I
had  sustained	a  knee injury which rendered me unfit for field operations and
had  been  given  a  choice  of  administrative  duty  or  partial   disability
retirement.  I quit but because of special qualifications I had,  I  maintained
an  inactive type of reserve status.  Occasionally I was called upon to perform
certain services for my former employer ... I was good at what I did.
After  almost  a  year	out  of  the hospital and in physical therapy I had
returned to my old job,  the one I had before going into the Army.  The company
I work for was my first job after college, they took me back and have been very
good to me since.
I felt that every emotion had been burned out of me during  my	service.  I
knew that I could feel nothing for anyone ever.  Women and sex was recreational
for  me and many times I did not even learn the names.	I was extermely selfish
and unfeeling.	I was sure that noone would ever touch me again ...  I was very
wrong.	Sometimes  I  think  back  and wonder if it would have been better if I
had never met her.
I  am deeply involved with someone very special to me and want it to remain
that way.  And Linda has recently come back  into  my  life  due  to  a  tragic
circumstance.
I think I am writing this as a form of therapy to help me  decide  what  to
do.  I	will write this as quickly or as slowly as I can,  when I have time.  I
am not a professional writer,  I can bearly spell.  My field is mathematics and
as  such  I  have  never  had to write.  If the reader finds this hard to read,
don't!  It is more for me than you.

It was a bright August day,  the sun was hot and the temperature was not too
high.  There  was  a  little note of the fall crispness to come in the air.  It
was one of those days when I got up early to do a little riding before work.
I got the 76 BMW R90/6 out of the garage, started her up, closed the garage
door,  turned on the radio and rode off.  After a quick ride to Jones  Beach  I
headed to work.  I was on Union Turnpike,  a major thoroughfare in Queens,  New
York,  when I saw her at the bus stop.	She was lovely	...  tall,  slim,  long
reddish brown hair ...	and she was waiting for the bus to go to work.	She was
wearing a very conservative full length summer dress  which  hid  almost  every
part  of  her  body  except  her wrists,  ankles and face.  She carried a small
reddish  brown  ladies'  attache  case  instead  of  a  pocketbook.   She  wore
sunglasses and stood tall and straight.
I pulled over to the curb and said hello to her.  She looked at me and just
nodded,  very cooly.  I asked if she was on her way to work.  She said she  was
and  that  the bus was late,  as usual.  I asked if she would like a lift.  She
looked at me and said that she would not get on that THING  even  if  her  life
depended  upon it.  I took immediate offense to that remark,  told her to FUCK-
OFF and rode to my office.
Three days later I took the same ride and saw her again, this time it was a
little later.  I pulled over to the curb.
"So you live here, huh?"
She looked at me and said that the bus was really late	and  if  she  were
late  again,  she  would  be fired.
"Well, does your life depend on it now?" I asked.
She asked how long it would take to get  to  work  and	I  told  her  20-25
minutes.  She asked if I was a safe driver.  I told her that any answer I would
give to that was purely subjective and therefore of no consequence.
"I'm wearing a dress, how can I get on that thing?", a little panic was  in
her  voice.
I  told  her  since she was wearing a dress that was much too long and much
too loose that it was easy.
"What's your name?"
"John"
"John what?"
"Just John, are you coming, I don't have all day."
OK, but drive slowly."
She got on,  tucked all of the excess fabric of her dress under her legs so  no
one would get a glimpse of anything above the ankle and we took off.
As  far as taking it slow,  well I have a problem with that.  I tend to get
from point A to point B as  quickly  and  efficiently  as  possible.  The  Long
Island	Expressway  is	always	fair game for a motorcyclist when he passes the
jammed cars.  I never thought she had the strength to hold on as tightly as she
did.  I think her eyes were closed all the way.
I finally got to her office building,  18 minutes flat.  She  got  off	and
just  stood there shaking.  I have the feeling she was as shaken by the ride as
by the earliness of  her  arrival.  She  was  over  an	hour  early  for  work,
something that had not taken place since her interview for the job.
"So, how was it?"
"Scary, but fun."
"Do you have a name?"
"Linda."
"Linda, what?"
"Just Linda."
I  thought  of	asking	her  if  she would like to get together later,	but
thought better of it.  I rode off telling her to have a nice day.
Two weeks later was the beginning of Indian summer.  In New  York  this  is
the  most  beautiful  of seasons.  The air was crisp and clean,  something that
almost never happens here.  I got up early and took another ride to Jones Beach
before work.  Yep,  you guessed it,  on my way there she was waiting for a bus.
I  pulled over and said hello Just Linda.  She laughed and asked if I was going
to  work.  The	second	ride,  much  less scary than the first,  was a lot more
comfortable and she  relaxed  a  bit.  We  exchanged  phone  numbers  and  made
arrangements to meet after work, if she could.	She was to call and let me know
what time she was to get out.
She never called,  so I figured she wasn't interested.  Oh well, that's the
way it goes sometimes.	I thought about it and, what the hell,	I wanted to see
her.  I  figured that since she had to be at work at 9:00,  she would be out at
5:00.  I took a chance.
When  I arrived at 5:00,  she was just coming out of the building with four  of
her friends from work.  They started to kid her about Hell's Angles  and  so
on.  She  just	got on,  they said to be careful and we drove off with her four
friends waving to us.
After about ten minutes she said she was hungry,  she had had no lunch.  We
stopped  at  a	Greek  restaurant,  parked  right  outside  (always unusual for
Manhattan) and went inside.  I could tell this ride had un-nerved  her	a  bit,
she was shaking a little.  We took a table over in the corner,	I  ordered  two
Ouzo's on the rocks and settled into talk.
After  some small talk,  four more Ouzo's each,  and a long story about why
she had not called me,	she was very busy and did not have much privacy in  her
office,  I  asked  her if she enjoyed the ride.  She said that she had liked it
and at the same time was very afraid.  She was wondering if this  had  anything
to  do	with  her  enjoyment,  however	small,	of the bike.  I told her that I
couldn't explain that to her now.
The evening went on and around 11:00 she said we had better  be  going.  It
was  OK with me since I had figured that she was too young and tied too closely
to her family to continue the relationship.  I took her home on  the  bike  and
the  most  extrodinary	thing  happened.  She  asked  me to come in to meet her
family.  I told her no,  I don't meet parents,  they never like me and it  only
causes trouble all around.  I left her at the door and said good night.
On  Thursday night she called me.  We talked briefly and agreed to see each
other again the following Saturday.  I would use the bike and dress  as  I  was
comfortable, she would wear jeans and ride with me.  I would pick her up at her
house and meet her parents,  but if there was anything negative from them,  the
whole thing was off.  I made it clear to her that I did not want any hassels.
Saturday came,	I showed up at the house on time and she answered the door. She
was  wearing jeans,  very tight at that,  and a red nylon sleeveless shell
top.  I had never noticed what a spectacular figure she had.  Her long hair was
in a pony tail and as she walked through the hallway  I  definitely  could  see
that she had a fantastic ass,  the type of ass designers like Jordache had been
born for.
She introduced me to  her  parents,  they  were  in  their  early  sixties.
Evidently,  she  was  the  baby  they had been wanting for a long time and this
immediately explained the overprotective environment she lived in.
I usually never get along with parents of anyone I date,  but this was very
different.  Her father and I hit it off like two old army drinking buddies.  We
talked	together for over three hours about his experiences with motorcycles in
the 1930's.  Some of the things he had done were incredible.  Her  mother  came
into  the  living  room and invited Linda and I to stay for dinner.  I said yes
without even asking Linda.
Linda and I never did get out  that  night.  At  2:30am  I  said  I  had  a
wonderful evening and I hated to go, but it was late.  Her dad said I could see
Linda anytime and he looked forward to seeing me again.  Linda showed me to the
door,  told  me  that  she  was  very  glad  her parents liked me and gave me a
goodnight kiss with her tongue that felt like she had gone down to my  toes.  I
told her I would see her again.

On the way home I thought to myself "If her old man knew the  lust  that  I
have for his little girl, would he be so glad to see me again?"
I called her on Tuesday and we arranged to meet on  Wednesday  after  work.
When the time came I picked her up in my car,  as it was a very dreary wet day.
When she got in she immediately gave me another one of	those  kisses.	I  told
her not to start anything that she did not want to finish.  She was still for a
moment	and  said she did want to finish it.  Forty minutes later we were at my
apartment and three minutes later we were in bed.  It wasn't the jeans that had
shaped this body, she was really built ... long, lean, young and tight.
She  had  very little experience in expressing her emotions,  there were so
many things she had never done before,	I felt like her  teacher.  Here  I  was
with  someone  16 years younger than myself,  beautiful and willing to do what?
And why?
I took her home  around  3:15am.  She  said  "Thank  you  for  a  beautiful
evening,  I hope I didn't disappoint you.  I have to see you tomorrow, please".
I told her she was not a disappointment and that I was busy during the day, but
she could meet me at my place later.  She agreed.
When I got home on Thursday,  she was there and we  went  inside.  She	was
very  upset.  I asked her if her parents had caused her problems.  She said no,
they like me very much and that it was something else.
To make a long story short she had split up with her fiance only three days
before the wedding.  She had been engaged for 2 years to this guy and had never
had sex with him, in fact she had never had sex with anyone until then.  He had
wanted to,  but she was deeply religious and did not.  Finally she gave in  and
it  was  a  disaster.  She  told him that she never wanted to see him again and
cancelled  the	wedding.  She  had  told  her  mother  what  happened  and  she
understood.
When  she  had  met  me  something  clicked  and she had desires she didn't
understand.  When she had gotten home after that first night in  bed  together,
she  told  her	mother	what had happened between us and her mother understood.
She didn't know if it was love or what she felt for me,  only that it was  more
than she had ever thought she could feel for anyone.
We  spent the rest of that evening in bed exploring her desires.  It got so
late,  I took her straight to work the next day and she called me later to  say
that  it  was OK with mom and pop.  I was very surprised.  I did not think that
parents could be that way.
I was to see her on Saturday afternoon to take advantage of  the  dwindling
Indian	Summer	riding	days.  A  bit  apprehensive,  I rang the bell.	Her dad
answered.  OH SHIT! I thought, here is trouble.  He said that she was not ready
yet and he wanted to talk to me.  OH SHIT, again!  We went into the living room
and I expected a real tirade, instead he said "John,  you have made my daughter
very  happy  and for this I am grateful.  I want you to continue to be with her
and give her empty life meaning.  She has had a  very  bad  experience	with  a
previous  person,  he  was  a real bum and we knew it from the beginning.  I am
thankful it is over and that she did not marry him.  She has a lot of  hurt  in
her  over  this and you are helping that.  You may see her as long as you like,
but I do not want you to just push her aside.  Is there anyone else that is  of
significance  to  you  at this time?".  I told him that I was not involved with
anyone else and would not be as long as I was maintaining my relationship  with
Linda.
She  came  into the room and dad said that we should have fun and not worry
about getting home.  Later I asked her about that and  she  said  he  knew  she
would be staying with me that night and he approved.  I was still in a state of
shock over his attitude.  Maybe some parents have their shit together.
Over the next five or six weeks we would spend the weekends together,  some
starting as early as Wednesday.  Finally I asked her if she would like to  move
in.  She  said	she had hoped I would ask her that.  We cleared it with mom and
dad and it happened.
I have a large apartment,  7 rooms,  rent stabilized,  in a  not  so  great
neighborhood.  She  helped me repaint and redecorate.  It was fun.  Things went
very well until about a month later when things got better.
I had been reading Penthouse's new magazine  VIVA  when  an  article  about
bondage  came  up.  She  seemed  fascinated  with the idea of how someone could
derive any pleasure out of being tied up.  I decided to show her.
I  secreted  several  36"  pieces of leather bootlaces under the pillow and
after we went to bed and she was sitting on my face,  I took one of  the  laces
with  one hand and put her hands behind her with the other.  I quickly tied her
hands together right before she came.  She exploded with her orgasm and  nearly
fainted.  I left her tied for a while as she came back to earth.  All she could
say was "WOW".
She  slept soundly and in the morning it seemed as if she could not believe
what had happened.  We talked about it at length and she  said	she  wanted  to
come  that  strongly  all the time and that whatever I could do to achieve that
was fine with her.  Sounded good to me.
While we were watching TV the next Friday night, she came over to the chair
where I was sitting and kneeled next to me.  She said she felt	that  this  was
her rightful place, kneeling by my side.  I also agreed with her.
Over the next few months  various items  found their way  into my apartment
... assorted  collars,	wrist restraints, ankle restraints, dildos, blindfolds,
hoods,	gags,  etc.  Our  bed started to have discrete attachments for clipping
into various restraints.  Her orgasms were beginning to be of concern to me.  I
was wondering if anyone ever died from too much pleasure.  I went to the extent
of consulting with a gynecologist about the extreme intensity of  the  climaxes
and was assured that no one had ever cum-to-death.  Just checking.

By this time we had been together for almost eight months.  Everything	was
fine with her parents, jobs were going well, the winter was mild, and basically
all  was  right with the world.  Linda was becoming a bit unhappy with her job,
so I suggested she go to college.  She applied to Queens College and got in.
This  was  a  blessing in disguise because our sexual activities had become
totally the dominant force in our  lives.  I  was  spending  most  of  my  time
thinking  of different ways to tie her up and she was spending most of her time
being tied up in those ways.  Our work lateness records were stretched	to  the
limit,	we  had  no  time for any friends,  we had not seen her mom and dad for
months and in short,  we had become  obsessed.	This  was  my  first  stage  in
learning that it is not how often you do something but how well it is done.
We had decided that she was going to take a full 12 credits,  after all she
was getting on in years and she did not want to be a student the  rest	of  her
life.  When you hit 21,  isn't it all downhill?  I kidded her that after 21 the
brain starts to deteriorate and learning is harder.  She  was  in  class  three
nights a week and with homework,  this diminished the available time  for  sex.
It also gave me some time to relax a bit and expand my ideas.
I  had taken one of the rooms that was used primarily for storage and moved
all  the stuff to a storage warehouse.	I put a lock on the door and would work
in there while she was at school.  I never let her into that room until it  was
finished.
The  room  was  17'x20' in size.  I painted the walls a dark grey and spent
many hours painting freehand so the effect of stone was achieved.  I  installed
beams across the ceiling that were solid,  not just decorative.  I installed on
one of the walls, a large cross made of wood with many large screw eyes through
which to pass rope.  I built a stock,  similar to the kind the	Puritans  used.
After all, what was good for them should be good for someone as pure as myself,
right?	I  also  built a bench/horse combination.  I put up several shelves and
racks to hold anything necessary.  I installed a wench system  secured	to  the
ceiling and tethered to one of the vertical beams.  I put simulated slate vinyl
tiles  on  the floor.  Several track lighting arrangements in various colors of
bulb, all fully equipped with dimmers,	were also installed.  At several garage
sales  I  located decorative swords,  axes,  daggers,  plaques,  coats of arms,
marble cupids (from an Italian sale in Howard  Beach)  and  basically  anything
that seemed to fit the motif of the room.
The first semester ended with Linda getting 3-A's and  a  B+.  I  had  also
finished  my puttering and figured we had two and half weeks between semesters.
She  had  some	vacation time left as did I,  so we decided to take off the two
weeks following Christmas.
Her  curiosity	had really peaked about the room,  since she had no idea of
what was going on in there.  I,  on the other hand,  had a  certain  uneasiness
about  it  since  I had put things in there I was almost certain we would never
use,  strictly for atmosphere.	The charcoal brassiere in the corner was one of
these  items.  I  had  purchased it at a theatrical garage sale,  complete with
about 7 branding irons.
We had Christmas dinner with mom and dad,  and went home late and  stuffed.
Christmas  day was very quiet,	all was right with the world and everything was
on an even strain.  Christmas time has always been especially depressing for  a
lot of old reasons, but this year it was mellow.
Linda  kept asking me about the room.  I told her she would find out later. I
went to the corner for a cigar and upon returning I saw her kneeling in front
of the door to the room with a flashlight,  trying to look in.	I went over  to
her and told her that she had been naughty and deserved a spanking.  Until this
time  I  had  not entered into anything but bondage,  no hitting or pain of any
type.  She stopped trying to look into the room,  stood up and gently undid the
tie  from  her robe and let her thin robe fall to the floor completely exposing
her beautiful body in the soft room light.  She came over to me, knelt in front
of me, bowed her head and said she had been a bad girl and deserved a spanking.
IT WAS TIME TO OPEN THE ROOM.

As she knelt in front of me I tied her hands in front of her body, promised
her  a	spanking,  blindfolded her,  lead her towards the room and unlocked the
door.  I took her to the center of the room and affixed her bound wrists to the
pulley mechanism.  I raised it enough so her arms were above her head  and  she
was  on her tiptoes.  I then put a gag in her mouth,  adjusted the lighting and
removed her blindfold.  After all,  didn't she say she wanted to SEE the  room?
As  a  final touch,  I bound her ankles together so she could not kick and hurt
herself.
"So, you were curious?  You could not wait for me to show this to you.  Let  me
give you a tour.  Over here on the right we have various whips	and  paddles
to  be	used  when  you  are naughty.  Here we have several dildos of different
sizes to be used when I wish.  Here we have the cross  to  which  you  will  be
bound  and  rendered  completely helpless.  This is the stock where you will be
put when I wish you to be in a semi-bending position.  This is the horse when I
require  a  fully  bent  position.  These  are	various items you may have seen
before.  This collar will be worn by you at all times." I put the 4" high black
leather collar around her neck.  It had several D-rings on it for future usage.
"What are these?  These are my collection of nipple clamps.  Yes,  for your
nipples.  This is the lightest, merely a pair of clothes pins painted black and
attached together with a light chain.  These others are for later".  With  that
I placed both clamps on her nipples at once.
She winced in pain, but after a few minutes I could see her stomach muscles
ripple in excitement.  I gave the crank a couple of turns and she was raised an
inch or so off the floor.  I sat down in one of the two  chairs  in  the  room.
One  was  a  bistro  type  with  the  wire back and this one was a large,  very
comfortable, black leather chair.  I had placed a small marble table next to it
and on this table was a cigar humidor and a crystal ashtray.  I took  a  cigar,
cut the end, lit it and sat back to see what would happen.
"So my lovely, how do you like our new playroom?  What's that?  Oh yes, the
gag.  Well  that  will stay for now.  You are very lucky I let you see this.  I
could  have always kept you blindfolded and you would never know what was here.
What is this?  Looks like a long feather from an unlucky peacock.  It is  quite
long,  as  a matter of fact I can reach you with it from here.	After all,  you
would not want me to have to get up when I am so comfortable."
I  took  the  long  feather and ran it down the inside of her right arm.  I
have always wondered what makes a person ticklish.  Now I can wonder what makes
a person hyper-ticklish.  It was truly amazing,  all I had to do was touch  her
with  the  feather  and she literally exploded in a series of spasms.  Normally
she was not ticklish at all.  I used to wonder why some  people  were  ticklish
while  others weren't.  Oh yes,  if I would sneak up behind her and poke her in
the ribs she would give  the  occasional  jump	now  and  then,  but  this  was
unbelievable.  With  each  time I brought the feather near I could see her eyes
widen in anticipation.	When I would touch her with the feather those same eyes
would close in ecstasy.  This went on until I finished	my  cigar.  The  Canary
Island long filler blend with the Connecticut medium wrapper was very good.
Linda hung there for about an hour.  The nipple clamps	had  obviously	not
been  an encumbrance to her,  so I logically concluded that they were too loose
to  provide  any sensation.  I got up,	walked over to her and gave the clips a
little squeeze.  Much to my surprise and satisfaction,	she came as I tightened
the  clips.  I undid the center of the chain holding the two clips together and
attached the chains to the D-rings in the collar.  The	chains	were  obviously
for  a shorter person,  Linda is 5'8" and rather well endowed.  The chains were
stretched tight from her nipples to the collar.  It was  a  magnificent  sight,
her floating there with these perfect tits uplifted ever so slightly by a light
chain  ending  with  two  clamps  on a pair of rock hard nipples.  The constant
tension seemed to provide constant arousal.
I  watched  her  for  awhile,  noticing  that  she  was  in a near state of
delirium.  Her breathing was deep and steady.  She made  little  animal  noises
like grunts,  which were difficult to discern because of the gag, but seemed to
mount to a minor frenzy.  Satisfied that her condition was physically stable  I
decided to go a little further.
"Oh yes, I almost forgot,  we came in here to give you a spanking for being
nosey, didn't we?"
With that I moved the horse in front of her.  I put the ankle restraints on
both  ankles,  securing  the  left ankle to the base of the horse and the right
ankle to the other side.  Her legs were spread and secured firmly to  each  leg
of the horse.  I uncliped the top of the pulley mechanism and rerouted the rope
through  the  guide  on the floor in front of the horse.  As I further cranked,
Linda's wrists were forced downward in front of the horse until she was finally
bent over the horse,  unable to move.  I strolled over to  the	wall  with  the
whips and paddles on it.  After selecting a rather innocuous paddle, I stood in
front of Linda's bentover body.
"I  have chosen the instrument which will be used for your spanking.  Would
you like to see it?"
As I held it almost in her view,  she tried  to  raise	her  head  but	the
tension  on  the  nipples  was	too much for her.  She would raise a little and
experience obvious pleasure and when she came up too much the intensity of  the
pain forced her to stop.  So, there is a limit?
I  walked around behind Linda.	God,  she had a magnificent ass.  Perfectly
shaped and always ready for anything I wanted.	In some ways it seemed wrong to
hit  so beautiful a creation,  but after all a promise is a promise and being a
man of my word, what was I to do?
The first stroke was a little harder than I had wanted it to  be,  but	the
reaction  was  definite.  I  could  tell  from	the quivering that she was near
orgasm again.  A little harder.  She winced and lifted	her  head  higher  this
time.  The third time - same strength, same reaction.  The fourth was the same.
The  fifth  was  significantly	harder.  To  my  surprise  she came in the most
violent orgasm that I had ever witnessed.  She went completely limp and started
to whimper softly.
Since she had sustained her punishment for  her  transgression,  it  seemed
time to release her from her situation.  I released her ankles first,  then her
hands,	then her gag,  finally I removed the collar and nipple clamps and  then
something happened.  She lifted her head,  looked at me, put her arms around my
neck,  kissed me very softly,  buried her head in my  shoulder	and  said  very
softly "Thank you".
The next few days were a bit hectic.  At that time I was in touch with much  of
my family and it seemed as if at least three of them were dropping in on us
every hour of every day.  Most of them, to look down their noses at Linda and I
for living together without benefit of marriage.  Thankfully,  they all finally
left.
We  had  had  little  time  to spend together during these days.  The usual
aunts and uncles that had come great distances of at least 3 or 4 miles and  as
such,  naturally assumed that staying until the wee hours was totally expected.
It was times like this that I had seriously considered putting up a sign that I
was not home, not that that would stop MY relatives.
By the time we would get to bed,  we both had headaches that would kill  an
elephant.  We  had  no time to ourselves in our own home.  This was a piss poor
situation and I had wanted to discuss what went on in the room Christmas night.
I wanted to know how she felt and what was to happen.  Finally the  opportunity
came.
We had a New Year's Eve Party to go to.  I had dressed and was watching her
dress.	She was to wear a black vee neck slinky dress.	As she started dressing
she  took  out	some  underwear  that  was new,  a garter belt and black seamed
stockings.  This is something that she had NEVER worn before and had said  that
she  felt very uncomfortable in this type of underwear.  Tonight was different.
She also took out a new pair of boots.  She looked at me and said  "It's  going
to be cold and wet tonight, I think I'll need boots for warmth."
These  boots created a warmth of their own.  They were a shinny black paten
leather with six inch spike heels and went over the knee.  She put them on  and
stood up,  turned to me and said "What do you think?".  She didn't have to  ask
twice.	Three  minutes	later  I  had  finished  the  phone call to our friends
telling them Linda had eaten something that did not agree with her and we would
not be there tonight.  So sorry, but what could I do.
I placed the collar around her neck and attached the nipple clamps  to	the
D-rings.  She knelt before me as I was to put the clamps onto her nipples.  She
said "Make them tighter this time,  please." I obliged and could see the ripple
of pain and pleasure go through her body. I attached a thin leash to one of the
D-rings and lead her to the door of THE ROOM.  As  I  unlocked	it,  she  knelt
again and said "Take me farther this time, please, I love it."
Inside the room, I placed the leather wrist restraints and ankle restraints  on
her,  tightened them securely, and attached them to the pulley mechanism.  I
raised her arms so she was a good foot off the ground and attached  her  ankles
so  her legs were spread wide apart and forward of her body.  She looked like a
kid on a swing going forward.  I sat down in the  chair  and  reached  for  the
feather.
After a hour or so of tickling her I started to hit her with the feather on
her ass.  She said harder, harder.  I soon realized that a feather was no match
for this luscious and willing ass.  I picked up  a  riding  crop  and  hit  her
rather  hard  across  both cheeks.  She flinched and said "Thank you,  my love,
again please, please,  please." After twenty strokes,  each one harder than the
one  before,  my  arm  became  tired.  She  was near orgasm,  but not quite.  I
reached for the cat-o-nine, a leather whip with about twenty leather strands in
it.  I showed it to her and said "I will finish you with this." She  looked  at
me and said "Do it as only you can."
The  first  stroke  left  many	red  trails on those beautiful cheeks.	She
flinched and came furiously.  Another stroke,  this time harder,  and again she
came.  Over  and  over	for  an  hour  or  more,  she kept coming more and more
intensely until finally I took a wide leather strap,  stepped in front	of  her
and  enterred her.  With each stroke I hit her soft red ass with the strap from
behind and she screamed for  more.  I  fucked  her  for  what  seemed  like  an
eternity.  She was in constant orgasm,	constricting her vaginal muscles around
my swollen cock.  I never knew anyone could have that much muscle  tone  there.
Finally I came deep within her.  She screamed "Oh GOD!" and fainted.
Uncertain  as to her condition after all this,	I felt for a pulse.  It was
racing but there.  What to do now?  I let her down slowly and  held  her  until
she  regained  consciousness.  She  looked up at me with her soft blue eyes and
said "I never knew anything could be that good."

Part - 1, Chapter -5

It was 4:20am,	she had collapsed and I  carried  her  to  the	bedroom.  I
placed	her  on  the  sheets and looked at her body.  There were welts and whip
marks on that perfect ass but there was a smile on her face that was  total.  I
had never seen her this happy before.
I  slept  till 9:00pm the following day and when I awakened she was holding  me
firmly, something she did not usually do as she preferred to sleep stretched
out on the bed rather than cuddled-up.	I kissed her gently and she made a soft
purring sound.
Later at what was to be breakfast, around 11:00pm,  she had a great deal of
trouble sitting down.  She was really sore but every time she went to sit,  she
moaned with pleasure.
We stayed awake for a few hours and then decided to go to bed.	We slept in
each others arms till 8:30am and then got up, showered, dressed and went out to
a local place for brunch.  She was very quiet  and  stayed  very  close  to  me
during	the  whole  brunch.  I said very little beyond what should we order and
like that.  For some reason she seemed to have a glow  about  her  that  I  had
never seen before.  She was absolutely radiant.
When we got home I told her that I wanted to discuss this whole thing.	She
said "My love, do not worry about what we do together.  You know how to make me
feel  things  that  I  have never felt or never thought could exist.  I am very
sore and I don't think that I can do anything like  last  night  for  a  little
while.	I loved it and I know now that I needed it.  I want to go further,  but
not now.  I love you with all of my being and  gratefully  submit  to  anything
that you can devise for me."
I  just sat there,  somewhat dumbfounded at what I had heard.  The next few
days saw the return of work and school.  Time was again short and since it  was
my  busiest  season  at the office,  we had little time for anything but rather
short and somewhat straight sex.
Friday afternoon came and she called me at my office and asked if I had the
time to go out that night.  I told her we needed to get out a  little,	so  she
should come to my office after work and we could go from there.
I  had brought the car to work since it had snowed the day before and there
was a lot of ice on the roads.	A motorcycle in New York is  usually  good  all
year  round  since  the  streets  are always so warm from the steam pipes under
them.  There are some exceptions and this was one of them.
She showed up at 6:15 with a copy of the Village Voice.  In there  she	had
found  a  place  on  Grand  Street called THE PROJECT.	I called the number and
heard a recording about a survey from Penthouse magazine and the  enactment  of
fantasies on stage.  Sounded interesting, so we went.
80  Grand  Street,  up one flight and into a dingy theatre setting we went.
Sitting on the floor with several couples on large  pillows,  the  show  began.
One man and one beautiful tall blonde lady enacted about 12 fantasies from many
letters  they  had  received.  10 of them were very funny,  complete with punch
lines like "She can't come to the phone now, she's all tied up".
After the performance  the  audience  was  invited  to	ask  questions	and
participate as much as they wished.  One man sitting next to us spoke in a very
hoarse	voice.	He  apologized	for this and explained he had just been through
Primal Scream Therapy.	He also said something that was very interesting ... If
you repress your fantasies, then they become obsessions and fetishes.  You then
exhibit abnormal behavior and become deviant.  If you allow your  fantasies  to
get  out,  then you are healthy.  So much for pop psychology and the screams of
the primal crowd.
We went to dinner and afterwards sat in the booth talking for  hours  about
what we had seen that night. What was normal, if anything was? How far from the
"usual  sexual  behavior" had we come and why?  We reached no conclusions about
anything.  I think it was that night we realized we had a very special type  of
relationship going and neither one of us wanted anything to happen to it.
I had never told her that I loved her.	In fact,  I told her that I did not
believe in love.  I believed that my capability for love had  died  many  years
ago in a far away war.	I really believed that I had no real deep feelings left
inside	of me.	I had never given it much thought till now.  I left the evening
thoroughly convinced that I did not want to understand any of this.  I was  not
interested in changing anything, nor was I interested in analyzing any of it.
I  asked her if I had hurt her when I whipped her.  She said there was real
pain,  but also a tremendous amount of intense pleasure and  she  would  gladly
endure anything so she could feel that way again.  She also said I was the only
one  she  would  ever  let  touch her.	This I did not know the significance of
until much later.
We went home and made love in several conventional ways. (At this time, you
must realize that conventional involved bondage, but no hitting, clamps, etc. -
that soon changed and with it, every part of both of our lives.

.
.   Over the next few months  our  use	of  the  room  stabilized  to  Saturday
afternoons  going  through  Saturday night into early Sunday morning.  This was
more out of necessity,	since she had to recover sufficiently to be able to  go
to work on Mondays.
.   The semester went well for her.  As before, three A's, but a C+ in the last
course.  She said she couldn't concentrate on the final  and  would  do  better
next  time.  I	was very happy and proud of her.  I decided she needed a better
place to study, so I took the small room and went to work on it.
.   She would study in my office area and I would work in the  little  room.  I
always kept it locked,	since I wanted to surprise  her.  The  room  is  small,
about  9'x11'.  I  painted  it  a soft blue,  trimming the moldings and door in
white which gave a Wedgewood effect to everything.  I installed a  medium  blue
wall to wall carpet,  put up a shelf system, brought in a walnut desk, a maroon
leather lowback desk chair and finished it off with two floor lamps and a  navy
blue  leather  easy  chair  with  a reading table next to it.  In short,  I had
outdone myself.
.   July  4th  weekend	came  and I thought I would surprise her with the study
room.  She was going to summer school to get ahead and was due to  start  class
in 3 days.  I put a dozen roses on the desk and locked the door.  I also put  a
large red ribbon on the outside of the door that said "For all your hard work".
When she came out of the bathtub, I told her I had a surprise for her. She came
over  to  me,  I handed her the key and led her to the room.  She looked like a
kid about to open her first Christmas present.	She fumbled with  the  key  and
finally opened the door.
.   What  followed  was  the  most  unbelievable reaction I have ever seen from
anyone.  She was both terribly elated and very disappointed at the  same  time.
What  was it?  She was very excited about the room for how it could be used and
for all the work I had put into it and also very disappointed that it  was  not
another dungeon.  We sat and talked about this.  She  said  she  wanted  to  go
farther  than  we had gone and had been afraid to say so,  since I seemed quite
happy with things the way they were.  I told her that a household  only  needed
one dungeon and we would do more and right now!
.   I took her into the "CAVE",  as I had come to call it.  Ripped off her robe
and pushed her to her knees.  "This time there will be no restraints" I said in
a  deep voice.  "You will accept what is to happen because you are powerless to
stop  it."  With that I took out a very severe pair of nipple clamps,  the kind
with the large alligator teeth on them,  and said to her "Put your arms  behind
your  back and raise your head".  She fully complied.  As I put the first clamp
on, she winced and said "Thank you, Sir". I put on the other one and she nearly
passed out.  A few seconds later she regained her composure  and  with	a  tear
rolling down her cheek she said "Thank you again, Sir".  I waited a few minutes
to  see  if she could stand this and when it was evident she would make no move
to remove them,  I lifted the light chain that joined them and	gave  a  little
tug.  She screamed softly,  looked at me and said "Thank you, Sir".  I told her
they would stay on for the remainder of the evening.  She smiled and nodded  in
agreement.  I then told her to stand and bend over.
.   "You  have been a bad girl and you need a caning" I said as I picked up the
English cane I had recently bought.  "I will  give  you  twenty  of  the  best.
Remember to count properly".
.   The  cane  cut through the air and landed just below her cheeks with a loud
crack.  Her whole body tensed as  she  said  "One....Please  Sir,  may  I  have
another...?" Her request was met with over and over until the last stroke.  Her
ass  was  blazing  red	and hot to the touch.  This was one of the times I came
close to breaking the skin and my wrist was very tired.  I do not know	if  the
reader realizes how much effort it takes to properly cane someone.
.   As I looked at her ass my desire to fuck her in it grew  and  realized  she
would  require	an enema to facilitate this properly.  I prepared the enema bag
with cold water, a little surprise this time, inserted the tube and let go.  As
I pulled the tube out,	I put in a small butt plug to hold everything together.
The cold water did have a certain surprising effect on her and she also  seemed
to  experience	a  small cramping sensation from it.  Since the cramps were not
severe	enough	to make her stand up,  I felt there was no reason to stop.  She
held that position for about 30 minutes until I told her to go to the  bathroom
and  relieve herself.  She did so,  returning quickly and resumed the position.
By this time I had a hard-on that would split a diamond.  I greased her ass and
entered it quickly ... if you entered slowly there would be no shock value.
.   She nearly went limp on me.  She put her hands on the  horse  to  keep  her
balance and screamed loudly "Harder,  Harder,  FUCK ME DEEPER....FASTER..." She
went on like this for quite some time.	When I finally came inside her, she let
out one final scream of ecstasy and went completely limp.
.   This had become a bizarre sight.  Here I was practically  holding  up  this
lady  on my cock.  I had no desire to exit,  but realizing that it might become
awkward to walk around like this I slowly withdrew.  She fell to the floor  and
lay there moaning softly.  I could see a small drop of blood from around one of
the nipple clamps,  so I went to remove them.  She stopped my hand saying  "You
said  they were to remain on."  I told her I thought they should come off so as
not to cause an infection.  She looked at me and said "If that is your wish, my
love."  I removed them and carried her into the bedroom.  I kissed her  softly,
climbed into bed and went to sleep.

.
.   The next five weeks went by very quickly.  Linda soon learned  there  is  a
lot of work to do when taking a course during the summer.  She finished with  a
B  and we decided to celebrate.  She took her two weeks of vacation and another
two weeks without pay,	I took four of my vacation weeks and  we  went	on  our
first trip.
.   Canada was absolutely beautiful.  We had taken the bike and  were  enjoying
our stay at  small  inns  throughout the Atlantic provinces.  The sun did her a
world of good.	She would lay on the red sand beaches of Prince Edward	Island,
while I avoided the sun.  You can always find me at a beach  ...  I'm  the  one
wearing jeans,	boots,	a long-sleeve shirt, hat, sun glasses, scarf around the
neck and gloves.  I have a fair complexion and burn  in  about	three  or  four
seconds.
.   She had acquired a warm glow to her skin  and  her	hair  had  gotten  much
lighter from the sun.  We would go to the cliffs and watch the sunset, for some
reason	it  was  much  more beautiful there than in New York.  It was really an
experience to not see the air you breathe.
.   We	had been there about 10 days when we decided to go to Newfoundland.  We
got on the ferry,  waived a very fond farewell	to  Prince  Edward  Island  and
proceeded to our next stop.
.   In case anyone is interested,  there is only one real city in Newfoundland,
St.  John's.  There are a lot of little coastal fishing villages,  but only one
city.  What  happens  is that the boys tend to stay in the villages and grow up
there,	whereas the girls go to the city and become typists.  Because of  this,
St.  John's  has  an  abundance  of  very  young  women,  many  of  whom  share
apartments.  It is not uncommon for five or six girls to share	a  one	bedroom
apartment, since salaries are low and rents are high.
.   One  night  we  were having dinner in a small pub and Linda said "I feel so
wonderful,  you do so much for me.  What can I do for you?" I told her she  was
doing plenty for me as is and she said she wanted to do more.
.   I  think a word of explanation of our living arrangements is in order here.
She was working as a low level secretary making  about	$190/wk.  Of  this  she
would clear about $130.  The apartment rent was about $279/month, I had no real
expensive tastes except cigars and I could well afford	them.  I  had  insisted
she put $50 a week into the bank, I paid the rent and the rest of the expenses,
she  paid for her schooling and books.	Anything for the house I would pay for.
I would choose most of her clothes and pay for them also.  All	I  expected  of
her  was to get an education and acquire a savings account.  I was also able to
put away a sizeable amount each month into tax-free securities for the	future.
In  retrospect,  I think I had once said it was MY apartment and she was living
with me,  not our apartment.  Why this was important to me I still do not know.
Anyway, with that understanding out of the way, we shall proceed.
.   As	we  sat having a cocktail, a young lady came in.  She wore a red dress,
very short and very tight.  She was small, about 5' tall and had a head full of
short blonde hair.  Her heels gave her another five inches and	she  was  still
short.	Somewhat like a miniature person.  Linda noticed me looking at her when
she  entered  the  room  and  I said "Wonder if she comes with her own carrying
case?".  Linda looked at me and said "Pretty,  huh?",  I nodded and  with  that
Linda got up and went over to the girl.
.   I could see them talking for a few minutes and then they both  walked  over
to  the table.  Linda said "I want you to meet my Master,  he would like you to
join us for dinner." I was a little shocked,  but said hello to  her.  After  a
few  drinks I learned her name was Jane and she was 18 years old.  She had come
to St.  John's about four months ago and was working as a  receptionist  for  a
real  estate  firm.  I	told her I could not understand why with all the vacant
land anyone would not want to buy any of it.  She didn't understand.
.   The meal was very nice, nothing spectacular, but nice.  In Canada meals are
of many courses, but much smaller portions than we eat in the US.  After dinner
we sat there trying to think of something to do.  Jane said there was  a  movie
in  town at the only movie theater and it was supposed to be good.  She had not
seen it because you had to be 21 to get in and she knew no one that  age.  What
was the film? "John and Mary" with Dusten Hoffman and Mia Farrel, filmed in New
York.  NEW YORK!!!  HOME!!!  Let's go!
.   The theatre was called the MOVIE HOUSE and the seats were the foldup  kind.
It held about 200 people and everyone seemed to know each other by their  first
names. As the movie progressed Linda and I got very homesick for the Big Apple.
There  was  one  scene	in the film I will always remember.  John met Mary in a
single's bar and she had spent the night with him.  In the morning she left  to
get some things for breakfast, John did not know that and thought she had left.
In  his  search  for  her,  he	goes  to  30th Street between Lex and Third and
approaches a man wearing a pink leisure suit,  walking two  miniature  poodles.
John  asks  the  man  if he can help him.  The man says "I hope so".  John then
asks if he has seen a girl and the man answers "A GIRL,  yechhhh!" Linda and  I
were the only two who laughed.
.   After  the	movie  we  left the theatre and walked outside.  Jane was on my
left and Linda on my right.
.   "Why does she call you Master?" Jane asked.
.   "It's my last name." I said.
.   "Oh."
.   "Come back to our hotel room," Linda said, "I think you'll enjoy it."
.   Jane  looked  at  me,  then  at  Linda and said "OK,  but I have to be home
early."
.   "What the fuck have you got on your mind?" I whispered to Linda.
.   "I want to give my Master a present." she whispered.
.   Nothing else was said during the time it took to get to the room.  When  we
were  there,  I  sat  down  in	the chair by the window and wondered what would
happen next.
.   Linda and Jane sat on the bed.  Jane at the foot and Linda up by the  head.
The  silence  was  so thick,  you could cut it with a knife.  We just looked at
each other for about five minutes.  I could tell Linda was not sure she  wanted
to do this and also not sure of what to do.
.   "It's  your  idea,  my  dear" I said to Linda in a sort of teasing tone ...
More silence.
.   "Why  does  she call you Master?" Jane asked again.  I reminded her she had
already asked that question,  but I understood she had a short	attention  span
and was probably going to ask it again.  As usual,  she did not understand what
I said.
.   "Because I belong to him completely,  body and soul.  My entire life is  to
serve  him  and  please  him.  And  in	this do I get such pleasure as I cannot
describe" Linda said to Jane.  "Aren't you getting a little horny?"  she  asked
the somewhat confused native.
.   With  that	Linda  got  up	and  walked over to Jane.  Linda unbuttoned her
blouse,  unzipped her leather skirt and let them  fall	to  the  ground.  Linda
never wore a bra except to the office.	She stood in front of Jane for a moment
or  two  and  said "My Master thinks I have the most beautiful tits he has ever
seen, what do you think?"
.   Jane just looked for a moment and said in a stunned voice  "They  are  very
nice."
.   "Feel them, aren't the nipples hard?"
.   Jane  just	sat there.  Linda raised her voice with another command to feel
them, took Jane's hands and put them on her tits.
.   "They are hard, so hard" Jane said, as she stopped trying to take her hands
down.
.   Linda  undid  Jane's  blouse slowly.  At first Jane seemed to protest,  but
with each button she became more and more agreeable.  As Linda progressed,  she
would look over to me for approval and I would nod each time.  Linda  knew  the
nod meant GO AHEAD.
.   After Jane was completely undressed, Linda lay Jane back on the pillows and
began  going  over  Jane's  entire  body  with her tongue.  I had never seen my
little,  quiet,  shy Linda do anything quite like this before and I was  really
enjoying it.
.   Linda  kissed  Jane several times on the mouth.  At first Jane pulled away,
but after awhile she held  tight.  Linda  said  "I  must  prepare  you  for  my
Master."  Jane  kept  saying  no,  but Linda kept working on her.  Finally Jane
said  yes.  She  made soft noises as Linda was eating her and then came for the
first time.  It was very mild,	well very mild compared to Linda,  but then who
could top her ferocity in that department. Linda did not let up for one second.
Each  climax  built  one on the other until Jane had started to grab the sheets
and moan over and over "OH God, Oh,  Oh,  Oh".  It was so soft,  I could hardly
hear it from across the room but I knew it was there.  Linda stopped, looked at
Jane and said "My Master will now fuck you in your ass".
.   "NO!" Jane said loudly.
.   Linda  just  kept  eating  her  over  and over.  I could see what Linda was
doing.	She would bring Jane close to orgasm and then back  off,  building  the
frustration  inside Jane until she would do anything for release.  I had taught
her well.  After about twenty minutes of Linda's tongue work and finger in  the
ass, Jane was more than ready.	I had removed my jeans and shorts and came over
to  where  the action was.  Linda reached out with her left hand and stroked my
cock until it was hard.  Linda then lay down on the bed,  face	up,  positioned
Jane on top of her, continued eating Jane and waived me on.
.   As	I entered Jane,  I could feel the tongue work that was going on nearby.
Linda reached up,  caressed my balls and I started to pump.  A	virgin	ass,  a
rare treat!  I pumped harder and harder until I felt the come start to rise up.
Linda felt it also,  so she increased her efforts.  Jane and I came at the same
time, while Linda was using her other hand on herself.	Although I never asked,
I think she came with us.
.   Later we sat around and relaxed.  I sat in the chair and Linda was	in  her
usual position, kneeling by my side with her head resting on my knee.  Jane lay
on  the  bed looking at both of us.  There was a long silence when finally Jane
said "It's late,  I have work tommorow."  She got up,  came over to both of us,
kissed me lightly,  kissed Linda long and hard, turned and walked out the door.
She said something like "It's been fun..." as she awkwardly walked out  of  our
lives forever.
.   Linda looked up at me for approval.  I felt like the luckiest  man	in  the
world.  I  looked  at  her and said "Why,  why her?" Linda just came closer and
said "I thought you would like her, was I wrong?" No, she wasn't wrong. "Why do
you call me Master?" I asked,  not really expecting an answer.  In the past she
had called me many things, mostly "My love" or "Sir" or even occasionally by my
name.  Why  now  the change?  We had not been in the Cave for about three weeks
and had not even done anything past mild bondage while on  vacation.  Why  then
was she referring to me as her Master?
.   "I have been thinking about you every minute of every  day  since  we  have
been  away.  I	know  I  belong to you totally.  I am your slave and you are my
Master.  Is it not right for me to address you as such?"
.   I sat there for a long time and thought about it.  I had  never  even  told
her I loved her,  I didn't know if I did or not.  We had been together for over
nine months and I didn't know how I felt  about  her.  She  was  there  for  me
anytime  I  wanted  her.  I  could do with her whatever I wanted.  We had never
talked about the usual	things,  marriage,  kids,  house,  etc.  We  were  just
together.
.   She seemed very happy most of the time.  True she had her down moments, but
somehow  I could get her out of them one way or another.  She had grown greatly
in the time I had known her and everything had been good.  There really was  no
negative side to all of this.  So why was I troubled about it?	I did the thing
I  do  best,  I  ignored  my troubled feelings,  rationalized the situation and
continued as I had always done.  I think I am a creature of inertia.  After all
she was beautiful,  bright,  witty and absolutely fantastic in bed.  What could
be  wrong?  Was not this the girl that anyone would give his left testicle for?
Why was I bothering to even have any doubts about any of this?

.
.   We returned home without incident.	I noticed I kept referring to it as our
home ...  there was a lot of "Our's" coming into play.  Linda was warm  and  as
beautiful as ever. The vacation had done her a world of good and she showed it.
We had two days left before returning to work, so we planned to rest up and get
ready  for  the  trips to the city in the mornings. Things were getting back to
normal.
.   We never discussed Jane again.  Linda did not mention anything about adding
a  third  person  to  our  scenes and neither did I.  I let it go as a one time
thing,	a special gift from her to me.	I  did	not  think  that  it  would  be
repeated.  How wrong I was.
.   School  was to start in a few weeks and preparations had to be made.  Linda
was busy in her study getting things in order.	Registration at a  city  school
is  never  a  pleasant	experience and requires more planning than a NASA space
shot.
.   One day when I came home from work, I found a large bouquet of red roses on
my desk with a little note saying "Thank you  so  much  for  both  rooms".  She
finally  acknowledged the study room.  This pleased me greatly and I was in the
mood to show it.
.   We	had  heard  of	a  place  having  stage  shows in the B&D arts,  so the
following Friday we decided to go.  Both of  us  were  excited.  The  place was
Belle  De Jour,  over on West 18th or 19th Street in a high loft with a theatre
setting.  The show started at 8:30pm and we were there.
.   What we saw on stage was of interest to both of us.  The scene was	simple.
A  man	was  on  the subway and he flashed a girl by opening his raincoat.  The
girl turned out to be a dominant mistress,  who  put  him  through  his  paces.
Another  girl  tried  to  help	the  man  and she too was then dominated by the
mistress.  All the events involved  restraints, such  as  handcuffs  and  rope.
After four or so scenes someone from the audience volunteered to  go  on  stage
and  submit  to  the mistress.	She humiliated him by calling him names and hit
him many times.
.   After the show Linda said I did not have to bind her  to  command  complete
obedience ...  that was a turning point in our relationship ... we both changed
that night.  As we were leaving the club,  she spotted an ad for a place nearby
called "Club - O", sort of a Plato's Retreat for the kinky set.  We went.
.   The  club had a few really nice things,  a sauna,  jacuzzy,  steam room and
several semi-private rooms on premises.  We had come for the first time and did
not consider participating in anything.  As luck would have it, we were  seated
next to a couple of newlyweds from Connecticut and discovered the wife had been
forced by her husband to come in order to expand their marriage.  I thought how
lucky I was that I didn't have to ask for anything,  it was there  for  me  any
time I wanted it.
.   A tall lady came over to us and introduced herself as Magda,  probably  not
her  real  name.  She  asked  if Linda would like to whip one of her slaves.  I
looked at Linda and said "Go ahead,  it might be fun."  Linda walked  into  the
center	of  the  room where this poor guy was tied to a cross.	She picked up a
small whip and looked at me and then Magda.  We both signalled her to start, so
she let out with a spirited first lash.  The sting served to  quiet  the  whole
room.  All eyes were now on Linda as she wielded the whip.
.   Magda screamed some obscenities at the man and Linda struck again, over and
over  until the man's back started to bleed.  He seemed oblivious to the entire
situation.  She kept hitting harder and harder until Magda told  her  to  stop.
Linda  snarled and told her she would stop when I said so and not before.  This
was a very tense moment ...  I looked at her,  waived my hand and  she	stopped
immediately.  She  put down the whip,  came over to my side and we left knowing
we would be back often.

.
.   For the next few weeks we would attend Club-O on Friday nights. Linda would
dress more and more the part and from her excesses had earned a  reputation  as
being  a  stern  mistress  who	had  little pity.  Magda was always there and I
wondered if she had a financial interest in the place.	The crowd  had	started
to  stabilize  from  the  once comers to the regulars and almost everybody knew
each other's name, whether real or not.
.   One  night we met a lovely lady named Prissy.  She was in her early forties
and looked a bit like  Ann  Margret.  She  sat  with  us  and  admired  Linda's
clothes.  Linda  was wearing a leather corset with stockings and the tall boots
we had both grown to like.  Around her neck was the spiked  collar  she  always
wore,  except  to  the	office,  and  also long black gloves with her rings and
bracelets fitted over them.  Her hair was up in a sort of  French  twist  while
her  leather  coat  was draped over the back of the sofa,  like a frame of some
sort.  The makeup was severe,  heavy eye shadow and deep lipstick.  She  looked
sensational to say the least.
.   Prissy asked if she would like to meet her Mistress.  I nodded my approval,
Linda  got  up	and walked across the room to be introduced.  The three of them
talked while I looked around the room.	The crowd was a little on  the	unusual
side  even  for  that  place.  There  seemed to be an excess of very submissive
young  men,  most  of  whom were gay or at the very least,  very effeminate.  I
started to become concerned when Linda did not return.	Up to this time  I  had
never  given  any thought to loosing her.  I guess I had never really cared one
way or the other,  but now I was feeling very uneasy.  I think I was not  ready
to let her go yet.
.   I got up and walked over to the three  ladies.  They  acknowledged	me  and
Linda said "Magda wants me to discipline Prissy,  should I?" I thought about it
and asked further about what Magda wanted my lady to do to Prissy.  Magda  said
only  that  Prissy  had  been a very bad slave and needed discipline.  I agreed
with Magda,  after all was it not Prissy who took my Linda away from me for  so
long  a  time?	Magda  suggested  that	we  leave  and	go to her house for the
session.  I had become bored with the place and agreed.
.   As we walked out  into  the  night	air  Linda  let  her  coat  stay  open.
Passersby  would  get  a  glimpse  of  that  magnificent body adorned in such a
fashion and all sorts of things would happend.	Just ask the cab driver who ran
into a telephone pole at 19th Street and Sixth Avenue.	I got a real charge out
of those sort of things,  since Linda was sooooooo conservative in  her  office
attire.  She  was such a different person here and I liked who she was.  I felt
a warm sensation about having actually created her in this form.
.   We got to our car and followed Magda over the Manhattan Bridge to Brooklyn.
The  house  was  a very old Victorian mansion in need of alot of repair.  Magda
led us into the hallway and opened the sliding doors to the library,  which was
outfitted a lot like the Cave at home.	There was much more here however, since
the  room  was several times larger.  I noticed about five or six chairs in one
corner of the room,  so curiously I asked  what  the  chairs  were  for.  Magda
explained.
.   She  said  this was her business as well as her pleasure.  She had over 300
clients,  many of whom were quite wealthy and paid large sums of money	to  get
their  rocks  off in the ways she could only do.  Magda further explained Linda
was worth $1,000 a day to her and she would like to buy  her  from  me.  I  was
shocked at a calm statement like this from a casual acquaintance. "How much?" I
said, partially without thinking and partially out of curiosity.
.   "$50,000?" Magda said quizzically.
.   My	mind  was racing with the direction this conversation had taken.  I was
both repulsed and intrigued with the thought of someone making	lots  of  money
doing these things. "You do this for a business?" I asked Magda. She started to
go  into  detail about a few of her clients,  some of them very powerful men in
the public eye.  I made an approximate estimate of annual  income  and	figured
about  four to five hundred thousand dollars.  I was real low.	Magda upped her
offer to $75,000 and finally $100,000.	She said CASH,	as if that was supposed
to  move me.  I sat back and quickly went through a few changes,  realizing all
at once that money was not as important to me as I had thought.  I  had  become
very  possessive  of  Linda  and did not consider selling her for any price.  I
became angry that this overweight, over-aged mistress would think she could buy
my lady.  NO!  What she was really trying to buy was me ...  I was not for sale
and  neither  was  Linda.  With  that I said we had nothing more to discuss and
tried joking my way out of the situation by saying I was not through with Linda
yet, but if I ever was I would let Magda know.	I suggested we should be going.
.   As we got up to leave Magda put her hand on Linda's shoulder,  pushing  her
back down in her chair. "You're staying" Magda said in a deep voice.  Linda got
up,  picked  up  a riding crop from the floor and put it sharply across Magda's
face.  "Don't you ever put a hand on me again" she screamed to Magda.  After  a
split  second  Linda raised the whip again and I interceded.  I grabbed Linda's
right arm just as she was about to  strike  the  second  blow  to  the	visibly
stunned  Magda.  I  took the crop from her,  put my arm around her shoulder and
apologized to Magda.  I did not want anymore trouble than had already  occurred
and  a	graceful  exit was very desirous.  Magda was capable of many things and
the situation was already very volatile.  I wanted no  violence  and  certainly
there  was the probability of such.  With little explanations to Magda of how I
would punish Linda for the attack, I lead her toward the front door.  I was not
really sure we would be able to leave without further incident.
.   We	made  it  to  the  front door while Magda was still recovering from the
blow.  I  put my right hand around the grip of the gun in it's shoulder holster
under my jacket and much flashed through my mind.  There were about  three  men
in  the  house  and  I assumed they were Magda's slaves.  Slaves will go to any
extreme for their Mistress and bodily harm was not  to	be  precluded.	I  also
thought  that  since  this  entire operation was 'outside the law' so to speak,
Magda would prehaps consider not letting us leave rather than risk exposure.
.   A man in a	leather  harness  and  leather	hood  approached  us  from  the
staircase, I drew the weapon, told him to stay where he was and he froze in his
tracks.  We went through the inside and outside front doors,  across the  porch
and down the stairs.  I opened the driver's side and gave Linda the keys.  "You
drive!"  As  she started the car I went around to the passenger side.  All this
time I had the weapon in my hand,  pointed at the door where two of  the  three
men stood watching.  I got in the car, she put it in reverse and moved out into
the street.
.   A few blocks later we switched so I could  drive,  Linda  was  shaking  and
shivering.  She looked at me and said she was sorry for not being more obedient
to  Magda.  I  told  her  to  forget it,  these were really weird people and we
didn't want anything to do with them anymore.  Linda started to cry and when  I
asked  why,  she  just cried and cried.  By the time we got home her makeup was
all over her face, a real mess. I took her in the house, washed her up, fixed a
bath for her and let her rest a bit.  The evening had been  a  bit  trying  for
both  of  us.  She  had  just  escaped	being  sold into slavery and I had just
avoided a lot of paperwork.  The local police do not take kindly  to  shootings
regardless  of	the reasons involved.  I had the necessary permits and licenses
for the weapon,  but there is always  some  technicality  that	can  make  life
diffucult, even when you are protecting yourself.
.   When I heard her crying again,  I went into the  bathroom.	There  she  was
sitting in the tub sobbing her heart out.  For a long time she said nothing ...
and then she spoke.
.   "I'm sorry, I'm sorry" over and over she moaned.
.   "For what?" I softly whispered to her.
.   "I  can't  let  anyone  else touch me,  even for you." She looked so guilty
about this.
.   I felt so relieved about the whole situation.  From the first  conversation
between Magda, Prissy and Linda I had considered the possibility of loosing her
for the first time and I knew then I did not want that.  Now I knew even more.
.   I lifted her from the tub, put a robe on her, kissed her softly and carried
her to bed.  As I lay next to her I said "I don't want  anyone  else  to  touch
you." I knew she did not believe me and let it go that way.  She cuddled closer
saying "Thank you, I love you so".  As usual, I said nothing.

.
.   We	spent  many  days  just  being	gentle to each other,  nothing violent,
nothing harsh, nothing but closeness.  I asked her to talk about the evening at
Magda's,  but she refused.  I wanted to say many things to her, but I couldn't.
What had happened that night, was there such a change?
.   Ronald  Regan  was	elected to his first term as President.  For this I was
pleased as the one thing I could not stand was another Democrat  in  the  White
House.	I was looking forward to an economic recovery.
.   On the following Friday, the second Friday in November, I came home late to
find  Linda  in  the  bedroom crying.  She had been that way for many hours.  I
went to her and said we must talk. "What's wrong? Is it something I've done?" I
asked.	She looked at me,  put her arms  around  my  neck  and	said  the  most
remarkable thing I had ever heard. "I wanted so much to please you and I failed
you.  I feel so terrible.  I'm such a failure.  I know you're ashamed of me and
I  am not worthy of you.  I love you so much,  but I want only you to touch me.
I will do anything for you, but please don't give me away."
.   I held her tightly and told her she was being stupid about this, especially
since I did not want anyone else touching her  either.	I  had	told  her  that
before and I meant it.	There was nothing to worry about,  I was not giving her
away,  I was not selling her and the thought of not remaining with her had  not
entered my mind.  I said I was very happy with her and did not want her to  go.
I told her we would never put ourselves in that position again and we would not
go to that club again.
.   This  was  the  first  time  I admitted I cared for her and did not want to
loose her.  If only I could make her believe me,  she seemed so sure it was her
failure.  How could I convince her the things that happened at Magda's  were  a
mistake.  I  would not have wanted it any other way and never considered having
Linda do with someone else any of the things we do,  for money or for any other
reason.  I  realized  it could have been due to the amount of trust I placed in
her,  I was sure we had an exclusive relationship  and  didn't  think  anything
needed to be said about it ...	another of the many times I was wrong.	Perhaps
if I had opened up a little to her, it would have been different.
.   Here  I  was,  relatively young,  successful in business,  having a totally
dedicated woman that many would kill for and I was unfeeling to  her  about  it
all.  We  had  been  living together for a year and a half and she was scared I
would give her away.  What could I say now that  would	make  her  believe  me.
Suddenly everything was starting to slip away.	I told her over and over that I
would  not give her away,  I wanted her and I would keep her.  I only hoped she
believed me.
.   January 20th came and we watched the innaugration on TV.  The hostages from
Iran were released and there were plans to celebrate their homecomming.  I  was
bitter	and withdrew into a shell ...  I know now it was because of the welcome
home I did not receive when I came home from Nahm and not any malice for  those
held  hostage  or  the incompetence of the last President.  If I had known that
then, it would have made a difference, but we learn too late if at all.
.   Linda had gone through another semester and had done well.	The grades were
well above average and she had worked very hard.  I was proud of her and wanted
her to know it.  As usual I could not express myself in a satisfactory manner.
.   The next semester started and she plugged along.  She was doing well and  I
was  happy with her.  Valentine's Day came around and I thought I would make it
special.  I  bought  her a full length silver tipped racoon coat,  a dozen long
stemmed red roses and a 5 pound box of candy in a heart  shape.  When  she  got
home  from  class  I told her I had a surprise for her and showed her the candy
and flowers first.  She was thrilled and held me tighter than she had in a long
time.  She looked up at me and said "You make me sooooo hot,  let's go  to  the
Cave, please."
.   Up	to  this  time	much  of what went on in the Cave was in punishment for
perceived transgressions, sort of a punishment for wrongdoings.  She had looked
for little things to do which would require discipline and  this  had  strained
the  relationship,  since I knew she felt she had to commit an offense in order
to obtain the pleasures of the Cave.  Now it was different.  Now she was to  be
rewarded  with	it,  rather  than  punished.  We  went into the room and had an
evening better than anything that had happened in a long time.
.   She took off her clothes and stood there in front of me  completely  naked.
She  let  her  hair  down,  looking soft and vulnerable.  The roses were in the
room. She had brought them in with her, saying they were too beautiful to leave
outside.  Compared to her they were just plain.
.   The  hard  clamps  went on,  the type having the levers so they can be made
very tight.  I placed them vertically on her nipples and they  immediately  got
rock  hard.  I	then placed the collar on her neck and attached the light chain
to the D-rings. She lifted her head and smiled with the pulling of her nipples.
She was home again.  She spread her legs and bent over exposing her ass.  "Give
me ten good ones,  please my Love?",  I picked up  the  cane  and  obliged  her
request.
.   She was getting wet and I  had  gotten  an	idea.  I  secured  her	wrists,
elevated her to tiptoes, put the blindfold on her and took up a rose.  I passed
it  under her nose,  she smelled it's perfume and purred.  "It's so lovely" she
said.  I passed the rose over her face,  it's soft petals brushing against  her
soft skin.  She murmured with delight, so I passed the flower over her breasts.
It  was  a  tossup  as	to  which  was smoother.  She shivered with a tingle of
pleasure.  I passed the flower down lower,  another shiver.  Over  her	cheeks,
another shiver.  Down her legs,  again and again and  then  went  back	to  her
breasts.
.   This time I decided to see if the thorns were of any attraction to	her.  I
told  her  even  a  rose  has  thorns and with that let one of the sharp points
slightly prick her left nipple.  She threw her head  back  and  said  "Yes,  oh
yes."  I pushed the thorn a little deeper into the hard nipple.  She started to
go into her usual pre-orgasmic spasm.  "More, more, more.....Please,  more."  I
pushed harder as she climbed higher and higher.  I then  switched  nipples  and
proceeded.  She  had  a  violent climax,  went completely limp and kept moaning
over and over to do it again.  I removed  the  clamps  so  there  would  be  no
deadening  of  sensation  and  then repeated the light pricking again and again
until she climaxed several more times.
.   I  lubricated  her ass and entered her,  keeping the thorns on her nipples.
Another  climax,  very intense,  and then I finally came inside her.  I let her
down and took her into the bedroom.  I ate her for hours and  then  fucked  her
until we both collapsed. She finally knew I was not giving her away.
.   We	woke up around 9:20am,	called the office to tell them we were taking a
sick day and went back to bed.	Later,	when we finally got up I looked at  her
nipples.  They	had each sustained  about  eight or nine little pin pricks  and
were sore to the touch.  She flinched when I  touched  them  and  applied  some
antiseptic ointment and a bandaid to each.  She looked like some of the ads for
porno  movies  where they cover up the good parts for the public.  We laughed a
lot about that.
.   I then remembered the coat I had not as yet given her.  I fixed a bath  for
her and while she relaxed in the tub,  I fixed breakfast.  When she came to the
table I told her it was a little cold in here and I would  get	her  a	heavier
robe.  I  told	her  to stand up and close her eyes.  I got the coat out of the
box and put it over her shoulders.  She opened her eyes and squealed with glee.
She started hugging  and  kissing  me  while  at  the  same  time  crying  with
happiness.  "Why,  I  love  it,  but  why?"  she asked over and over.  When she
settled down I told her it was something I  had  wanted  to  get  for  her  for
sometime and Valentine's Day was the best time to do it and, yes, I was keeping
her.

.
.   Over the remainder of the semester things went  very  well.  We  approached
the  start  of	the  summer  with a great deal of anticipation,  it had been an
unusually cold winter with much of that white stuff I  find  so  repulsive.  My
feelings  towards snow are that it is something to see through a picture window
while sitting next to a fireplace, not something to go out into.
.   Linda had now finished two years of school and was actually  a  junior.  If
she had gone to a community college, she would have earned an Associates Degree
at  this  time.  In  her  job  this  would  qualify  her for a promotion to the
position of Executive Assistant,  a relatively meaningless title  but  worth  a
$2,000 a year raise and less menial duties.
.   I prompted her to approach her boss with this information and  request  the
upgrade.  She was very shy about anything assertive,  so we rehearsed the scene
several times with me playing her boss.  When she was well prepared I  wrote  a
formal	request  for  the  promotion.  This  request  was a four page document,
including a complete course description and planned course of study culminating
with a degree in Business Administration.  If I do say so,  it was  a  work  of
art,  more  of a legal brief than a short note covering all the company's rules
and precedents for the past three years.  She was all set to go for it.
.   The plan was to see her boss on Monday afternoon,  after  all  nobody  does
anything on Monday morning, and we fully expected the changes to be made within
two weeks.  We chose everything very carefully,  down to what she was to  wear.
Instead  of  the  usual  dress-type outfit,  I had bought  her a navy blue pin-
striped business suit,	complete with a white blouse and a basic single  strand
of  pearls.  She put her hair up,  making her look like an up and coming junior
executive, and went to work.
.   When she came home, I asked how it went.  Perfectly, she told me.  Her boss
was very impressed and said he would take care of everything.
.   On Friday we were to have lunch together,  but she called and said her boss
had  asked  her  to  lunch.  She  guessed the promotion had come through and he
wanted to tell her the news over lunch.  She called at about 3:30pm asking if I
could leave early and pick her up.  I could tell she was upset, so I told her I
would be right there.
.   At home she told me what happened.	Her boss had said she  could  have  the
promotion,  if	she would sleep with him.  She did not know what to do,  so she
told him she would get back to him. I was outraged. She had earned every bit of
that promotion and he was a son-of-a-bitch to try anything like that  with her.
I had a plan.
.   Monday  she  went into his office and said she wanted to understand what he
had said on Friday.  He spelled it out for her and admitted she had worked hard
to get through that much school while working full time and her performance  on
the job was quite good.  He said she could have the promotion and go to another
department,  but only if he recommended  it.  She  told  him  she  couldn't  do
anything like that. He said too bad and that was the end of it.
.   Two  weeks	later  we  met	in  the  office of the Chairman of the Board of
Directors.  Linda, her boss, myself,  my attorney and a small tape recorder she
had carried in her purse.  We played the tape and it was quite good.  Her  boss
should have gone into the theater, his voice carried so well and every word was
crisp  and  distinct.  Afterwards  my attorney suggested the appropriate action
would be  a  lawsuit  for  violation  of  EEOC	(Equal	Employment  Opportunity
Commission) codes and ethics.
.   In order to prevent such an action	a  few	concessions  had  to  be  made.
First,	there was the promotion and a guarantee that there would be no punitive
action against her in the future.  This was agreeable to the Chairman.	Second,
there was to be her boss's immediate resignation from the company.  This  hurt,
since  he was there 9 years and was just three months short of being vested for
his pension.  The Chairman said he would take it under advisement.  My attorney
said this offer was good only until the close of business today and tomorrow he
would  pursue  the  normal  course of action.  With that he and I got up,  said
"Good day gentlemen,  we have concluded our business",  I took Linda out of the
office and we went home.
.   Later  that day my attorney called and told us Linda would be reassigned to
a new section when she reported to work in the	morning,  since  her  boss  had
resigned.  She	would  start on Monday as an Administrative Assistant.	She was
relieved beyond belief and I told her I would not let anyone take advantage  of
her,  even  if it meant loosing her job.  The money was completely unimportant,
this was about a principle, and I fight for principles.
.   We	later  learned	her boss had to sell his house,  since he found it very
difficult to find employment at the salary he had  been  making.  His  marriage
broke  up,  but that was not our fault.  In short,  the good guys won one for a
change.
.   Due  to  the episode with her job,	I saw a new side of Linda.  With me she
was confident, assertive,  dominant to others and submissive only to me.  Apart
from  me,  she	was very shy and would never rock any boat ...	this started to
bother me.  I would notice things that showed me she  was  unsure  of  herself.
She would never take the car out without me,  she seldom drove and when she did
it was for a short time.  She had trouble  making  decisions  of  the  simplest
nature.  Things  like  shopping  for  clothes  alone were unmanageable for her.
Food shopping was another area where there was a bit of  disagreement.	If  she
did not have a fully detailed list, she would buy nothing.
.   I began to get really pissed at this dependence upon me and what I had  not
realized  was  that  nothing  had really changed with her.  In the beginning we
would do all those things together,  so she had never done them apart from  me.
I just began to notice these things and this was the way it had always been.
.   I started to talk to her about these  things  and  she  interpreted  it  as
picking  on her.  She would get upset and say if I didn't like her for what she
was,  then I should say so.  I told her I did like her for what she is with  me
and  I can't understand the change when we are apart.  It was as if she was two
different people.  Discussions on this point never seemed to get any place,  so
after several weeks I did the thing I do best, I ignored it.
.   I had started to worry about whether there was something really wrong  with
her.  Aside  from  the	split  behavior about her assertiveness,  there was her
sexual behavior.  She either enjoyed the most tender and sweet	loving	or  the
most  violent and painful style.  This appeared to be another two sides of her.
How many personalities did she have or were these just different sides of  her?

.
.   The  summer was here again, the  economy  had  gone  up  and  with	it  the
hemlines.  There  seemed  to  be  a  resurgence of patriotism in the air as the
fashions turned to khaki,  pewter,  gold  and  silver  colors.	The  kids  were
wearing old army jackets again, but this time they were clean and crisp.  Linda
was  rummaging	through some of my old army gear and after finding two or three
jackets  that fit her,	she asked about the collection of ribbons on my Class A
uniforms ... three Silver Stars, four Purple Hearts and some twenty odd others.
I looked at them for a long time and told her I did not want to talk about  any
of  it.  I  gave  her the three jackets and put everything else into the trunk,
locked it and removed it to the warehouse for storage.	I have	not  opened  it
since.
.   The country was on an upswing and I considered buying stock,  for the first
time in my life.  It was only logical to take advantage of companies that  were
in trouble.  Con Edison was my first blunder into good fortune.  It seemed they
had had some kind of crisis that made them stop paying a dividend, so the stock
went from mid 20's to 7.  I bought several shares,  much against the advice  of
financial  experts.  I reasoned that when I turn on a light switch,  there will
be electricity, especially in New York.  Again I bought quite a bit more shares
at 8 1/8 and there it sits to this day.  Chrysler was the other stroke of  good
fortune.  I  reasoned  that  since I owned a Chrysler product the company could
not go out of business.  I bought several shares at 3 7/8, more at 4 1/4,  more
at 5 1/2,  finally a nice chunk at 6 3/4 and they  still  are  with  me.  As  a
matter of fact with the current dividends, I cannot afford to sell them.
.   This summer we decided she would not take any courses.  There was a lot  of
pressure  on  her  during school and with the recent developments at her job we
both needed a little rest.
.   I had thought much about her dependence upon me for  strength  and	decided
that in order to develop her confidence I would ask her to drive when  we  went
out.  After  all,  isn't  driving  in New York City one of the most competitive
things anyone can do?  I also had her enroll  in  an  evening  Adult  Education
course	on  Assertiveness  Training,  which met three times a week at the local
high school.
.   At the same time Verna, a girlfriend of Linda's from work, left the company
to work elsewhere.  She was a Licensed Practical Nurse and for those of you who
are not medically knowledgeable this means that in a private  company  she  was
THE  COMPANY  NURSE and in a hospital setting she was in charge of the bedpans.
Verna left to go to a hospital,  assuming a nurse's place  was  there.  In  one
short  week  she went from the head of a rather small medical department to the
next lowest form of life in existence and the change was a bit	more  than  she
could  handle.	She started calling Linda at least three or four times a day at
the office and almost every night,  and stayed on the phone for  hours	pouring
her guts out to Linda.	I think Linda was privileged to every rotten thing done
to Verna over and over and over.
.   Some background on Verna is in order.  She was 31 years old, never married,
lived with her mother in a rent controlled  apartment,  4'9  1/2"  tall,  short
black hair and a little overweight,  which was made up for by a very solid pair
of DD cups.  In short Verna was very Italian.  It seemed that for some	unknown
reason	Verna  had  never connected with a man on a permanent basis.  She would
usually date someone three or four times and then her mother would interfere to
end the relationship before it began.  And now with  the  job  change  and  the
crazy work shifts, Verna seemed unlikely to have a man in her life.
.   Linda  had started to pity Verna a great deal,  while I had started to wish
we didn't have a phone.  Compassion for the suffering of  fellow  human  beings
was  not my strong point,  so why when Linda told me Verna was going to meet us
after work on Friday was I pleased?  Because Linda had made a decision	on  her
own and that was what had become important to me at this time.	I told Linda it
was  OK  but,  since  we  would probably be responsible for Verna's safe return
home,  we would have to take the car and Linda would have to drive.  Fine  with
her.  Fine with me.  Maybe she was learning something.
.   Verna  met us at a local bar near my office.  She was right on time,  since
she only worked about ten blocks away.	She was dressed in a bright blue  scoop
neck  dress ...  God she had huge tits ...  and I introduced her to a few of my
single friends from the office.  It was really funny because she was  so  short
and  anyone  I would introduce her to would just stare down at her chest.  With
some it was deliberate,  with others it was unintentional.  Over the  next  few
hours Verna met four or five men, none of whom could describe her face.  Around
7:30pm Linda told Verna about The Project and how much	we  had  enjoyed  going
there.	Suddenly  Linda suggested that the three of us should go there tonight,
we would be in time for the beginning of the show.  As I  said	before,  I  was
pleased to see Linda asserting herself, so we went.
.   The performance was almost the same as before,  although this time I  found
it  much  more amusing.  I could see a great deal of humor in the events taking
place and Verna was totally transfixed by what was happening, since  Linda  had
told  her  very  little  about what the show was actually about.  At the end we
left before the audience participation began and Linda invited	Verna  back  to
our  place  for  coffee  and cheesecake and I agreed to drive.	It seemed as if
everyone had enjoyed themselves.
.   We got home rather quickly,  had coffee and cake and then  sat  around  the
table  talking	a  bit.  Then  Linda asked Verna if she wanted to see something
really special.  Verna agreed and I just sat back and waited for  what	was  to
happen.
.   Linda  took  Verna's  hand  saying "Walk  this way", while I laughed and of
course said "If she could walk that way..." an old burlesque line.  Both  Verna
and  Linda  chuckled  and as they approached the Cave Linda told Verna to close
her  eyes to get the full effect.  Verna obliged,  Linda opened the door,  took
Verna inside and sat her in the Bistro chair.  Quickly Linda took Verna's hands
and tied them behind her,  so she could not get up.  Verna  started  to  object
rather	adamantly,  so	Linda  put  a gag in her mouth.  Linda then slapped her
across the face and said "Now you will see for yourself,  and if you move  I'll
beat  the  shit  out of you".  The look of fear in Verna's face told Linda that
she wouldn't move even if her life depended upon it.  Linda bound each ankle to
the legs of the chair and called to me,  "Master,  please come  and  check  the
knots".  I had a hard time getting up from the dining  room  table,  I  had  to
stop  laughing,  since	I  thought  it would ruin the mood.  Finally I went in,
approved the knots and told Linda she  had  done  a  good  job.  I  thought  to
myself, OK, now what?
.   Linda  started  with  a tirade directed at Verna about how fucking sick and
tired she was to hear about all of her little petty problems  and  how	all  of
those  really pissed her off.  This lasted about thirty minutes and when it was
over there came the question of what to do next.  I had sat down in  the  other
chair  and  watched  the whole scene.  In many wy]
RW,s very happy that Linda
had gotten all that off her chest.  Hummmm,  chest?  Seemed a terrible waste of
such  a  beautiful chest.  Several thoughts were going through my mind,  all of
which had no socially redeeming value.  Let's see how far we can go.
.   When Linda had nothing more to say,  I told her to	kneel  before  me.  She
obeyed.  I  told  her  how  proud I was that she had taken matters into her own
hands and now we had a slight problem of what to do  either  with,  to	or  for
Verna.  I told her to find the solution.  She thought for a while and said "Let
her watch." Seemed good to me.
.   Linda got up and removed her clothes.  She went over to one of the	shelves
and got the stiff nipple clamps,  the leather wrist bracelets and leather ankle
bracelets.  She put on her collar,  put her hair in a pony tail and then put on
her garter belt, black stockings and high boots.  She came over to me and knelt
in  front  of  me.  I lifted her face,	gave her a long hard kiss and whispered
"Are you sure you want to do this?  Verna is not a stranger." Linda nodded  and
said  "She  doesn't  have  to  be  any  more."  I did not really understand the
significance of that statement until much later.
.   I put the wrist and ankle restraints on her,  fastened the clamps in place,
led  her  to  the  suspension  line  and  a  few minutes later Linda was in her
favorite place.  I had taken one of the cat-o-nine tails, applied rouge to it's
tips and with each stroke a red trail was left behind.  Verna's eyes started to
bulge in disbelief of what was happening, while Linda would moan loudly and beg
for more.  In her traditional pre-orgasmic  pace,  she	would  climb  a  little
higher	each  time I would scream at Verna about how she was to be next.  Verna
struggled in the chair, although I was not really sure Verna was to be next, so
to speak, and whether or not I really wanted her to be.  I hooked the center of
the chain from the nipple clamps onto a thin wire I had secured to the ceiling.
I also clipped the ankle restraints to the ropes, which would force her legs up
and apart.  She hung from her arms with her legs spread wide apart and forward,
and  considerable  tension  on	her nipples.  Her tits pointed straight upward.
The sight was a bit much for Verna as she sat there in her chair unable to move
or call out, she started to whimper.  The sound drove Linda higher and higher.

.   Linda screamed over and over "Make her suck your cock".  I went  to  Verna,
took out my tool,  removed her gag and placed my dick in front of her mouth.  I
did not want to force her to do this,  since I was a little  worried  this  may
constitute  some  sort	of rape and I was not really interested in that.  Verna
looked up at me for a minute and then began to suck.  It was her choice and  so
much  the  better.  I  was  hard  in  no time and Linda was still hanging there
mumbling "Suck it,  suck it,  bitch." After several moments of fairly good oral
stimulation,  I  withdrew to go to Linda.  "A present from Verna" I said,  as I
plunged into her quivering body.  She came instantly and I fucked  her	without
mercy  for a long time.  She kept crying out for Verna to watch how a good fuck
is.  She kept coming and coming until I finally exploded.
.   Neither one of us had noticed I had not put Verna's gag back in place  over
her  mouth  and she was sitting there watching everything that happened without
objection.  I returned to my chair and rested,	Linda was a real  drain  on  my
strength  and I needed to sit down.  Linda hung there pulsating and moaning for
about fifteen minutes and when she finally come down far enough  to  deal  with
reality,  I  got  up  and  loosened  her  restraints.  I lowered her gently and
carried her over to the chair.	I sat down and draped her on my  lap.  She  put
her  arms around my neck and her head rested on my shoulder ...  We stayed that
way for a while.
.   "What about Verna?" I said to her.
.   "Fuck her." Linda said.
.   "I don't think I have anything left."
.   Verna sat motionless for a while and then finally spoke.
.   "Do you always do that?"
.   Linda looked up at her and said "And much more.  You want some?"
.   Verna said nothing,  she sat there obviously having a hard	time  believing
what she had just seen.
.   After Linda had regained her composure,  she stood up,  looked  at	me  and
asked "Can I have some fun with her?" I said if it was agreeable with Verna, it
was ok with me.
.   "Will you watch us?"
.   I told her I would.  I thought this would  be  interesting,  since	I  have
always	liked  the  idea of two girls making it together and Linda had not done
this since the Canada trip.
.   She went over to Verna and put her hand to her face.  "I will pleasure  you
beyond  your  wildest  dreams."  Verna just sort of nodded.  I could not really
tell if there was approval, fear or desire behind that nod.  Linda untied Verna
and helped her to her feet.  She started to run her hands  over  Verna's  body,
concentrating  on  her  breasts.  She  undid  the zipper on the back of Verna's
dress letting it fall to the ground,  revealing  that  Verna  wore  a  bra  and
panties  with  no  stockings  or pantyhose.  Linda took off the bra and most of
Verna's chest lunged forward.  She could have knocked Linda  over, if  she  had
been  a  bit closer.  Linda then knelt in front of Verna,  removed her panties,
spread her legs and began to use her tongue on her.  After  about  ten	minutes
Verna  started  to  hold  Linda's head in her hands,  pushing her face into her
nether regions.
.   Linda got up and took a double ended dildo from the wall.  She inserted one
end  in  herself  and  approached  Verna.  She	lifted Verna onto the horse and
inserted the other end of the dildo into her wet  cunt.  Back  and  forth  they
both  went  until  Verna  started moaning "Faster,  faster,  faster." Linda was
coming	again,	I  could tell from the quivering going through her body,  while
Verna came all at once.  She grabbed Linda,  thrusted her deep inside  her  and
just  grunted.  After  that she said "Stop,  stop".  Linda did not listen,  she
kept up the pace until Verna came a second time.  "OH,  God...." Verna screamed
very  loudly.  Linda  did  not let up.	A third time for Verna.  I had begun to
become concerned for Verna and wondered  if  Linda  would  ever  stop.	Finally
after about three or four more climaxes she did.
.   They both collapsed in a pile of sweat and latex on the floor and lay there
for a while.  Linda looked up at me with a wild look in her eye and said  "Your
turn, Master." She moved over to me and began to get me hard, she could do that
in  no	time.  I  sat  in the chair and Verna willingly sat on me.  I went deep
into her and began to pump.  After a few strokes she came,  after a few more so
did  I.  Linda	was  sitting  beside  the chair and when she realized Verna was
coming, she slapped her ass with her hand. "Bitch" was all she said.  The three
of us slowly regained our composure or what was left of it and retired	to  the
bed, where we slept.
.   Saturday  afternoon  soon came and we got up.  Verna was very withdrawn and
hardly spoke at all.  Linda was very stiff and sore from  the  proceedings,  as
she usually was after a session.  Because of the intensity of our encounters we
were  forced to limit ourselves to the weekends in order to allow Linda time to
recouperate.
.   Verna sat at the table just staring at both  of  us,  so  I  got  a  little
annoyed  and  asked  her  if she had a problem.  She just nodded her head,  no.
Linda looked at me and suggested I go into the living room while she and  Verna
had a little talk.  Feeling a little uncomfortable with Verna staring at me,  a
trip to the living room was certainly not out of the question.	They talked  in
whispers  for  about  an  hour,  then  Verna called a cab and left.  Linda just
looked out the window as the cab drove away and said "She'll be back."  And  so
she was.

.
.   The end of the summer was always a time for regrets.  With	the  fading  of
the warm weather would go the few short weekend motorcycle trips we would take.
Often  times  we would go to the New England area,  anything within two to four
hundred miles.	Another thing that was to be missed  was  our  vacation.  Since
her  promotion	she was entitled to three weeks instead of two and this year we
had gone to Florida to visit my mother.
.   We had visited my mother before,  but not on the bike.  For some reason mom
had  never  gotten  used  to  the  idea that I was older than 10.  Florida is a
strange state for many reasons.  One real cute custom they have  is  to  assume
anyone	who is considerably younger than yourself is your son or daughter.  How
often we would go to a restaurant and the hostess would  make  a  reference  to
where  you  and  your father would like to sit.  And any time Linda would order
anything alcoholic,  she would be asked for proof of age.  The driver's license
was  not  sufficient,  neither	was  her student ID,  but with her work ID they
seemed satisified.  She got a kick out of it all,  I found it  boring.	I  will
have  to admit she was quite youthful in appearance.  Since there are no helmet
laws in Florida,  she would put her hair in two pony tails,  one on either side
of  her  face.	This  only tended to make her look younger.  I by that time had
grown a full beard and	although  I  would  not  freely  admit	it,  the  beard
contained a significant amount of grey.
.   The trip to Flordia contained a side trip to Tarpon Springs, a Greek sponge
fishing  town.	Her  tight  leather  pants and bikini top turned many heads.  A
small resturant had Oysters for $2.00 per dozen and  she  said	she  had  heard
rumors	that  oysters made you passionate.  We overdosed on them,  but were not
sure they increased anything.
.   Key West was a strange town,  mostly English settlers  who	dealt  in  Real
Estate.  Condos were everywhere and they even tried to sell us one.  At the end
of every day,  there was a ceremony on the dock to celebrate the setting of the
sun ....  bagpipes,  a couple of other musicians,  poetry readings and applause
when  the  sun	went  down.  We  were so moved by this,  we decided it would be
really great to make love on the beach as the sun set.
.   We located an out of the way place and set up for a barbecue.  After eating
we waited for the sun to get lower in the sky.	She removed her swim  suit  and
lay  back  on  the  blanket.  We began in earnest and after a few minutes heard
some noises.  It seems a couple of elderly tourists were  above  on  the  rocks
taking	pictures  of  us.  We  pulled the blanket over us and continued.  Later
that night,  after getting all the sand out of her private places,  we	did  it
right.	Never again anyplace where there is sand.
.   We	left  the Keys after overdosing on Key lime pie and gin and tonics.  As
we went up the coast,  we realized the main  form  of  commerce  was  marijuana
smuggling.  A  state trooper had pulled over a sixty foot tractor trailer truck
crammed full of bales of the weed.
.   Next  stop	was  Tampa.  Here we saw the old cigar factories and mingled in
the Cuban community for a day.	After placing orders for choice  cigars  to  be
shipped home and buying a few souveniers of the trip, we headed home.
.   We	arrived  back  on  a  Thursday	and had until Monday to relax and play.
Throughout the time we were away,  we did none of the things we would do in the
Cave.  She missed them a lot and so did I.  I tried to discuss with her why she
was so different away from home and  just  kiddingly  I  said  she  was  almost
normal.  She  got  real upset at that and started to cry.  She said if I didn't
like her the way she was,  then all I had to do was say the word and she  would
be  gone.  Wasn't  much of a conversation,  but at least she was being a little
assertive.  Maybe there was some progress.  I told her not to worry about it, I
liked her the way she was.  She asked to go into the Cave,  saying we had a lot
to make up for.
.   When she was inside,  appropiately bound and suspended,  she asked if there
were  any  roses  around.  Unfortunately  not.	What to do in their place?  She
said she wanted the thorns,  so to oblige her I retrieved  several  long,  thin
sewing	needles.  The  initial	prick  started	her  fever  mounting.  She kept
demanding more and more until  I  had  actually  pierced  the  nipple  straight
through.  She  screamed as it went through and then begged me not to remove it.
I did the other one and her fever increased.  I decided to lower  her  down  to
the  chair.  Her  arms	were  still  bound over her head and as I entered her I
would twist the needles a little.  The fever got faster and faster.  She  began
coming	and  coming  while her spasms got more intense.  I could not tell if it
was from the very active fucking I was giving her or from the  turning	of  the
needles.
.   As	I  would  aproach orgasm,  I would slow down and then start over again.
She had not stopped,  she just kept coming.  She gripped my member very tightly
and  would  not  let  go.  She	had that glassy eyed look she gets when she has
crossed another limit.	I lifted her  nipples  by  the	needles  and  she  went
further.  There  was  no way she was still of this earth and I did not know how
to bring her down,  in fact I was not sure I would have even if I knew how.  We
stayed like that for several hours until she collapsed.
.   I  was  near exhaustion and wonderred why I always had to carry her to bed.
To further complicate matters there was the question of what to  do  about  the
needles.  I had sterlized them with alcohol, but was not sure what to do now. I
put some antibiotic ointment around one needle and removed it gently.  She made
no  move,  so  I assumed she felt no pain.  I did the same to the other needle,
applied two small bandaids and the process was complete.
.   When she awakened the next day,  her nipples were  very  sore.  I  was  not
surprised at this, although she seemed to be.  It was time to have a long talk,
I  was becomming more and more worried about the things that gave her pleasure.
It seemed that anything we did always had  lasting  effects.  Some  were  short
term  and others,  like the nipple situation,  would last longer.  She said she
did not want to stop,  she did these thing because she loved me  so  completely
and  if  I  cared  for	her,  I would not deny her the expressions of her love.
Sounded even logical,  I had a hard time trying to refute any of it.  As usual,
I did nothing.

.
.   School had started,  we were both back to work and I had decided to go back
to  school  for a Master's Degree.  This was my way of filling some of my spare
time while keeping Linda company at the same time.  After being out of	college
for  almost twenty years,  I was somewhat concerned about my ability to do that
sort of thing,	but figured I should also be willing to go through it  since  I
had asked her to do the same thing ... sort of as an example to her.
.   Verna finally called Linda on a Thursday night.  We had  not  spoken  since
that  night  last  summer  and did not think we would hear from her again.  She
said she had thought a lot about that night and had become intrigued about  the
two of us,  so Linda asked if she would like to join us for the weekend.  Verna
accepted even though I felt she was being manipulated by Linda.
.   She made it to the apartment around 10:30pm on Friday.  She had had  a  few
drinks	prior to arriving,  undoubtedly for courage,  but she was there.  Linda
took her coat and led her in.  Linda  was  dressed  in	her  usual  outfit  ...
garter	belt,  stockings  and  those  boots.  She  removed the robe she wore to
answer the door and just stood there in  front  of  Verna.  "This  is  for  the
weekend, you understand?" she said.  Verna just nodded in agreement.
.   I  asked Verna why she came and she explained she was not really sure.  She
had  been  terrified  in  the  beginning,  but	later got some sort of perverse
pleasure out of what happened.	She was very confused as to how Linda could get
pleasure from what she did and wonderred if she could also get any pleasure out
of it.	She also said Linda promised she did not have to participate if she did
not  want  to.	She  had  thought a lot about it and wanted to.  I informed her
that Linda would be  responsible  for  her  training  and  if  there  were  any
infractions,  I  would punish her.  I also told her she could stop any time she
wanted to,  but she would have to leave and not return.  Linda then started  to
undress  her.  I  waited  for the removal of the bra,  I wanted to see if Linda
could move that fast again.
.   We took Verna to the Cave  and Linda secured her  over the horse.  "Shall I
whip this worthless bitch,  Master?" I nodded approval and said "Remember,  she
is  a beginner." Linda started with her hand,  very gently and between each few
strokes she would fondle Verna's cheeks.  After a half hour or so  Verna  began
to  make  a  soft  purring noise.  I went over to feel her ass and found it was
starting to get warm to the touch.  Verna was beginning to enjoy  the  session.
Linda had brought her along slowly,  getting harder and harder with each stroke
while telling her how lovely she was.  Verna was hooked.
.   Linda continued, stopping every so often to caress Verna's body, especially
her tits.  At one point Linda looked at me and said "She's such a cow, shall we
brand her?" With that Verna became very uneasy.  She  kept  mumbling  something
about  being afraid of fire or not being burnt.  I had no intention of branding
her  and  was  hoping Linda would not want to go further than she herself would
go,  especially with a novice.	I called for a time out and took Linda into the
other  room  to talk things over.  I wanted to know just what she was doing and
how far she wanted to go.  I explained I was enjoying little Verna and did  not
want to really harm her.  I also reminded Linda this was for the weekend, so we
would  have  plenty of time later to go farther.  Linda sort of agreed.  I told
her this was as it would be and there would be no fluctuation from these rules.
Linda knew these were my orders and they were final, so she obeyed.
.   We went back into the Cave and I addressed Verna.  I told  her  she  had  a
beautiful ass and was doing fine.  I asked how she felt and she told me she was
not  sure how she was feeling,	but it was not bad.  She said she was turned on
and curious.  I told her she should have no fears of being branded,  the  irons
were  only  for show,  not for use.  She seemed more at ease.  I patted her ass
and mumbled something about curiosity and cats.
.   Linda went back to work on little Verna,  this time with  her  tongue.  She
did  service to Verna's cunt as well as her asshole and those enormous nipples.
Linda said she could not get the entire nipple into  her  mouth,  I  tried  and
could, but my mouth is bigger.	As Verna climbed higher and higher, Linda would
caress her more and more.  At one point she tied her hands, brought her over to
the  suspension  pulley  and raised Verna to her tiptoes,  however with Verna's
lack of height that wasn't far.
.   Linda  then  began	to  investigate those huge tits.  Neither one of us had
seen anything so big on anyone so small.  Verna wore a size 30DD bra,  most  of
them  were  special orders or custom made.  They tended to minimize the size of
her breasts and had a slimming effect overall.	The end result was that instead
of making Verna look like she had the biggest set in the world, these bras made
her look like a middle aged REALLY DUMPY Italian girl.	Looking at her	hanging
there, I could only wish the head of Maidenform would be taken out and shot for
incompetence.
.   The girls looked like they were playing.  Linda  was  moving  Verna's  tits
back and forth and Verna was giggling like a school girl.  Every so often Linda
would  take a little nip at either nipple.  Verna would make a surprised little
noise and utter something like "Ouch", then she would slide back into her giddy
state.	Linda kept it up with harder and harder bites until  Verna  started  to
groan  a  little.  Linda  then took out the lightest of the nipple clamps,  and
placed	them  on  each	nipple	while  kissing	Verna.	 Verna	was  a	 little
uncomfortable  for a while,  but that soon passed.  She looked down at her tits
and gave a stupid little smile.  Linda and I were along side Verna  as	I  said
"You have taken your first step." She seemed pleased and so was Linda.  For the
remainder of the evening we took turns working on Verna.  We gently brought her
to  climax  after  climax and when she was thoroughly satisfied,  we turned our
attentions to each other.
.   We	went  through  to  late  Saturday afternoon when the idea came to me to
involve Verna in something she would find  hard  to  believe.  I  whispered  to
Linda that I would use the needles on her.  This excited her,  since I had only
used them once a month or so.  I  was  worried	about  any  kind  of  permanent
damage,  but  everything  seemed to heal quickly and without incident so I just
accepted it as a "no problem" situation.
.   Linda went to Verna and got her to her feet. "You will attend me." she said
to the bewildered little lady.	She led Verna to the medicine chest  where  she
removed the alcohol,  needles,	surgical needle holders, gauze pads and a small
stainless steel platter.  She  wiped  each  piece  with  the  alcohol  and  put
everything  on	the tray.  She led Verna into the Cave and told her to kneel on
the mat and put her hands up,  so she may hold the tray.  "You will hold  these
for my Master and if you drop anything, you will take my place."
.   With that Linda knelt in front of me,  looked up and spoke in  a  soft  and
delicate voice "My Master,  your slave has been good to you,  please lift me to
the limits that only you can bring me to.  I submit completely	to  your  power
and  beg you to indulge me in my pleasure." The look on Verna's face was one of
total disbelief as my lovely slave knelt there totally unbound, lifted her head
high,  took a deep breath and placed her hands at her side.  She nodded  and  I
proceeded.
.   I picked up the first needle with the small needle holders and passed it in
front  of  her  eyes  several times.  She did not blink.  "Please,  Master" she
whispered.  Verna's hands began to shake,  so Linda turned to her and  reminded
her  she  would  take her place if anything fell.  Verna regained her composure
and  I	proceeded.  The  first	needle	went  through  the  left  nipple  on  a
horizontal.  Linda was perfectly still as I slowly inserted it through her soft
skin.  She raised her head and whispered "Thank you, Master, please another."
.   Verna looked on in disbelief as we proceeded.  Linda took four needles, two
in each nipple,  one horizontal and  one  vertical.  She  looked  at  Verna  in
triumph  and  said  to  her "You're lucky you did not drop anything." I thought
Verna was going to faint.
.   I kissed her deeply and told her how proud I was of her.  She looked at her
nipples,  went	on  and  on  about  how  special  this was for her and tried to
convince Verna to let me do the same to her.  I put a stop to that real  quick,
after  all,  this was Verna's first experience with any of this stuff and I did
not want to scare her away.
.   Linda was then suspended by her wrists and had the needles put under slight
tension from two small wires attached to the ceiling.  She remained  there  for
several  hours.  I  bound Verna's hands behind her back and placed her kneeling
in front of Linda.  She was to service my lovely slave with her tongue	and  if
she  stopped,  I  would strike her with a ridding crop to remind her of Linda's
promise that she would take her place.	I emphasized this from	the  beginning,
Verna got the point.
.   This went on for several hours until it was time to remove the needles.  It
was around midnight on Saturday when the removal was to take place.  Linda  had
been  brought  to  orgasm many times by Verna's talented tongue while I too had
shared Verna's oral talents a few times during the day. We were all  exhausted,
but  there was the realization that the events were not over.  Linda and I both
knew  that the removal ceremony was as important as the insertion and Verna was
to play the same role again.
.   The  attendant  knelt  obediently, much more steady this time,  as my slave
prepared herself for the finish.  She knelt  in  front	of  me	with  her  body
drenched  in  the sweat of a hundred climaxes and her hair matted with the same
sweat.	On anyone else it would have been repulsive,  but on her it was  as  if
she had a glow about her.  She was breathing very fast and heavy, her heartbeat
was  racing.  She took a deep breath,  lifted her head and put her hands at her
sides.	The rules were that these severe things were only done out of  bondage.
If she were to lift her hand,  I would stop immediately ...  this was my safety
valve.
.   One  at  a time I removed the needles.  She quivered with the same pleasure
as she did during insertion.  After the last one  was  withdrawn,  she	gave  a
shudder.  It  was over for this time.  There would be more,  but for now it was
over.  I could tell the experience had been  the  usual  success.  She	was  as
horny as hell.
.   I  opened my robe and she immediately found my limp member.  Twenty seconds
of her oral charm changed me into a rod of iron.  I sat back in the  chair  and
she  mounted  me.  We  went like that for what seemed an eternity.  She rode me
like a rodeo  star,  getting  higher  and  higher  and	started  screaming  and
convulsing  violently.	She  held  me  tightly both with her arms and her inner
muscles.  I could not escape,  nor did the thought of doing so	ever  cross  my
mind.  I don't know if I really came, I was completely tapped out.
.   We	remained like that until the early rays of dawn broke through the heavy
curtains.  Verna had fallen asleep.  Linda and	I  just  held  each  other  and
looked	into  each  others  eyes.  It  was  times like this that I noticed what
beautiful eyes she had and,  conversely,  when we looked into each other's eyes
we would think of this sort of time.
.   Around 10:00am we woke  Verna  and	the  three  of	us  sat  around  eating
breakfast.  We were completely wasted and could barely speak.  We had not eaten
since Friday and had not even noticed it.  Our stomachs  were  empty  and  made
gurgling noises when we ate ...  Breakfast rolls, strawberries, dark coffee and
orange juice.  Simple fare, but all we could deal with.
.   Verna then slept on the couch while Linda and I retired to the bedroom.  We
all awakened around 9:45pm.  Verna got dressed and I called her a  cab, since I
was not up to driving nor almost anything else.
.   As she left,  walking very slowly,	she said she had a great time and would
be back.  She was, OFTEN.....

.
.   Winter  came  quickly  this year,  the snowfall was early and prevented the
enjoyment of the Autumn.  There was a cold dampness in the air that was  deeply
penetrating.  The  flu	season	was upon us in earnest and Linda prompted me to
get a flu shot.  We both went for it.  I was out for three days with fever  and
chills,  whereas she had no reaction at all.  Since I had gotten the shot at my
company,  they felt a certain responsibility for my reaction to it  and  I  was
given an extra week off to recuperate.	It took a lot longer.
.   Up	to  this  time Linda and I had been disagreeing about the publicness of
our relationship.  Until last March my mother and sister knew nothing  of  her.
This  was  not	by  design,  but more by omission on my part.  Her parents knew
about us,  and although they had no idea of what we did in private,  were  very
supportive  of	our  togetherness.  This  was  one  area  where  we  had  great
differences of opinion.  I felt the people we  were  close  to	at  the  office
should	not  be deliberately denied the knowledge that we were a couple,  while
she on the other hand felt it was not for public  knowledge.  I  reasoned  that
since  Verna  had  joined us,  the secrecy barrier was broken and we should not
avoid this any more.  Linda reasoned Verna would say nothing,  since she didn't
want  to spoil a good thing and both Verna's reputation in a major hospital and
our escapades would depend upon discretion.  After all,  Verna would spend  two
or three weekends with us every month, depending upon her schedule at work.
.   The  problem  came	to  a head with my next promotion.  November 1981 was a
very good time for me.	I  had	become	an  officer  of  the  company  and  had
increased  responsibilities along with a large increase in pay,  not to mention
the fringe benefits and perks and the company was sponsorring a Christmas Party
for all executive officers.  Since then  there	has  been  a  change  in  upper
management philosophy, so these events are no more and as luck would have it, I
was in the last year of this event.  Attendance was almost mandatory and  since
I had just made "the big time",  I was naturally expected to attend.  The party
was at the Plaza Hotel, black tie.  I told Linda about it and she said I should
go alone.  She was quite adamant about this point, calling the event everything
from silly to too rigid for her.
.   Our first fight then promptly ensued.  The whole bit ...  yelling, threats,
if you don't like it then get out,  etc.  etc.  ...  thoroughly distasteful.  I
finally  told  her she would go or be gone when I got back.  This seemed to get
to  her.  She  cried  a  bit,  threw  a  tantrum  and  then  settled  down.   A
depressingly long discussion then followed.
.   She told me she was afraid of many things, one of them was loosing me.  She
felt if anyone would know of us, they would try to break us up.  She was afraid
I would find someone else and be done with her.  She was absolutely sure  there
were  many  people  at	my  office  that  would snatch me up in a minute if she
weren't around.  I told her this  was  all  nonsense.  She  spoke  about  being
faithful  to me,  she had never once thought of another man.  I was a bit nasty
and asked her about a woman.  She became very upset at that, it was a low blow.
I realized she took me very seriously and suddenly I had really hurt  her,  for
the  first  time.  I  felt  terrible about what I had said and tried to explain
that I believed in her fidelity. I knew the only others had been Jane and Verna
and that was for us,  not just her.  I told her  I  enjoyed  the  sessions  and
outside of those occurrences,  I had no others since her.  We were both telling
the truth,  after all what energies did we have left for anyone  else  and  who
else  could handle our special desires as well as each other.  What I never did
get around to telling her was that I  was  not	ashamed  of  what  we  did  and
certainly  not of her.	I can see now if I had told her that at the time,  much
could have been avoided.
.   Finally  she regained her composure and we came to an agreement.  She would
go to my Christmas party and I would go to her company's New Years' Eve  party.
We further agreed that we would not hide the existence of our relationship from
any  acquaintances  or	not-so-close friends.  If asked directly,  we would not
deny we lived together or  that  we  were  lovers.  Neither  one  of  us  would
unnecessarily divulge that information,  nor would either of us try to hide it.
I was too blind to see it was her guilt of what she did and wanted to  do  that
she was really trying to hide.
.   One  minor	concession  on	my  part  was the next day.  In preparation for
Christmas I would always get Linda a piece of jewelry,	something of the season
or  something  I  would like to see her wear.  I had gone into a little jewelry
store in the lobby of my building at lunch  looking  for  such	a  bauble.  The
jeweler  was  a friend of mine and I would chat with him often.  He said he had
something special for me this time.  He wasn't kidding.  1  -1/2  karats,  pear
shaped, mounted in a Tiffany setting and the price made it too good to pass up.
The  thought  of  having it reset into a pendant was uppermost in my mind,  but
I thought it over and decided to  give	it  as	a  ring.  An  engagement  ring?
Maybe, maybe not.
.   Her dress for the Christmas Party came in, so we went for the final fitting
and adjustments.  She was a perfect size 10 except for	her  chest,  which  was
more  of a 12.	There were always problems that could be solved only by getting
in both sizes and picking the one needing the  fewest  alterations.  The  dress
was  a	floor  length cranberry velvet with a low scoop neck.  The size 10 made
her breasts overflow the neckline and I wondered how dancing with her would be.
We took the size 10 with no alterations.
.   We went to a French restaurant in  the  mid-forties  between  6th  and  7th
Avenues.  A  French  restaurant is a place you go to when you want to be abused
by French waiters,  pay exorbitant prices to eat miniscule portions  of  almost
raw meat and, more to the point, when you have something special to say.
.   After the pastry and coffee,  I started to tell her why we	were  there.  I
gave her the ring,  put it on her finger,  a perfect fit, told her I wanted her
to have it and what it would signify was up to us to decide.  I said I had very
deep feelings for her and if she would like,  we would be married.  If the idea
of  marriage  was  not for now,  then she could wear it until the idea was more
palatable.  It was very simple,  I wanted her to have it and anything that went
with  it  and  she  could  decide how much that was.  She just looked at it and
suddenly realized I was not about to hear anything about  her  taking  it  off.
She  just  said she loved me so completely and would accept it as an expression
of how we felt for each other.	I was pleased.
.   The day of the Christmas Party came and  we  took  off  from  work.  In  my
position  it was expected because of the party,  for her it was one of those 24
hour virus things that go around.  It had been three days since I gave her  the
ring and we had not talked about it since.  Now was the time.  She said she did
want  to  marry me and was afraid to bring it up before,  because of our way of
making love.  She was afraid it would change and she needed it	so  very  much.
She also was afraid if she did not marry me,  I would find someone else and she
would loose me.  Either way she was very scared.  I told her I had no plans  of
changing anything between us and was not looking  for  something  different.  I
was proud of her and felt our feelings were not to be hidden.  Our private life
was  just that,  private.  True we shared some of that with Verna,  but she was
just something we both had fun with.  We could get along  without  her	and  it
would not change any feelings between us.  I made it clear that the ring was no
pressuring of marriage and it could be as soon or as late as she wished it,  if
at all.  Until such time when she was to leave or we were to  be  married,  she
would  be  considered  my  fiance.  It	was decided and that night I introduced
Linda to many very envious associates as my  fiance.  Deep  inside  I  think  I
wanted it to work.
.   The party was a tremendous success.  We had two dances together and many of
my friends asked how long we had been seeing each other.  The response was that
we  had  known each other for about two years.	Had we set a date yet?	No,  we
had only recently gotten engaged and were not sure when the date would be.  The
usual bullshit about finding a place, etc.  There were those who were skeptical
at our relationship.  She was so much younger than  I  and,  if  the  truth  be
really	known,	she  was  far  more attractive than I would be expected to have
acquired on my own.  She was one of,  if not,  the most beautiful lady	at  the
event.
.   For  the  next  few  days  I  received  a  lot  of	heckling at the office.
Everything from the remotest implications that I had hired her for the	evening
or  she  was my sister.  I have a strange crew at the office and I paid them no
real attention.
.   A week and a half later there was the New Year's Eve  party at the  Waldorf
Astoria  and  her  company  spared  no	expense  in  throwing this bash for the
employees.  1250  were	eligible  to  come  and  370  showed  up.  Never  could
understand  passing up an affair like that,  especially since it was free.  She
wore the same dress and looked just as good.  The crowd was  generally	younger
than  at  my  company's  party  and there was little said about us as a couple.
There was only one other person there that I knew,  the Chairman of the  Board.
We exchanged pleasantries and never mentioned the previous incident.  I got the
feeling it was something he would rather not remember and I felt the same.
.   We left shortly after 1:30am.  I had rented a limo	for  the  night,  since
driving  on  New Year's Eve in New York City was totally inconceivable to me as
was any mode of public transportation.	She was  very  happy  at  the  way  the
evening  turned out,  as if she realized there was really nothing to fear.  She
put her head on my shoulder and  said  she  didn't  want  this  night  to  end.
Everything seemed right, I didn't want it to end either.
.   The next few months passed quickly and we  discussed  with	her  parents  a
possible marriage.  They were very pleased and her father and I spent much time
talking  about	things.  He was glad we had decided to do this and said he knew
we were right for each other,  although her mother  was  not  so  outspoken.  A
tentative  date  of  early  June 1982 was partially agreed upon by all parties.
The wedding was to be informal and the reception was to be small.  From time to
time I had to reassure Linda this would not change things between us,  it could
only make them better, or so I thought.
.   Our  sessions  with  Verna	seemed	fewer  and  farther  between.  Her work
patterns were getting out of hand and  we  had	discussed  the	possibility  of
cutting  her loose.  Both of us were reluctant to do so,  since she had come so
far.  She was our toy and we did not really want to loose her.	April 1982  and
Verna's job changed.  She was now an administrative person.  Her day, 7:00am to
3:00pm Monday through Friday.  Every weekend was free and she spent  them  with
us.  Just as this was getting tiring tragedy struck.
.   Linda's father passed away from a stroke on May 3rd,  1982 ...  our wedding
plans  were cancelled,	since her mother needed her for support.  They had been
married for 41 years.  He had been retired for the last 8 or so years and  they
spent all their time together.	Her mother was completely lost without him.
.   Linda  could  not  finish  the  semester  and  took five incompletes in her
subjects.  Her teachers were understanding and allowed her to make up the  work
over  the  summer.  She did.  Linda spent a lot of time with her mother and our
weekend diversions were few and far between.  Verna offered to stay with me  so
I  would not be lonely,  but Linda did not like that idea,  neither did I.  One
Friday night when Linda was at her mother's  house,  Verna  stopped  over.  She
said  she  was	really	horny  and  wanted  me	to  do something about it.  She
suggested calling Linda and knew she would say it was alright.	I told her that
without Linda I had no interest in her and  she  should  leave.  She  said  she
would but if she did leave,  she would not be back.  I told her I didn't give a
shit and she left.  She also lied, Linda would have objected, quite strongly.
.   I  sat  there  wondering about what I had just done.  All kinds of thoughts
went through my head ...  Had I just screwed up a good thing?  Why had I turned
her down?  Was it really only Linda I wanted?  Or was it  that	without  Linda,
nothing  made  any  difference?  Did  I  need her that much?  A long time ago I
swore to myself I would never let anyone get that close to me, it hurt too much
when they left.  What had happened to that oath?
.   Linda got home around 9:45 that night and said  her  mom  was  better.  Two
weeks  later on July 7th, 1982 her mother passed away  from a massive coronary.
Many would think she died of a broken heart.  I was one of the many.
.   After this shock had befallen us,  there was a period of  great  quietness.
Nothing  happened.  There was no sex,  no dining out,  no movies,  nothing.  We
were both a little numb from the prior events.	We needed time.

.			      Part - 4, Chapter -2
.
.   At the end of August we decided to take our vacation.  Linda  had  to  take
her's before October 1 and I could use some time off.  The prior few months had
been  hard  on	both  of  us.  I had told Verna to buzzoff several times and it
seemed as if she had listened.	In a strange way we both  missed  her.	We  had
made  no plans to go anywhere for vacation so we figured we would get the place
straightened up and take some short trips on the bike.
.   We finally decided to call Verna and reached her  just  in	time.  She  was
trying	to  think  of  what to do on her two week vacation and I got the bright
idea to have her spend it with us.  She thought about it until I said  "In  the
Cave".  I guessed she missed it a little also.
.   The next 13 days were the most exhausting of my life.  Verna had progressed
to the point where she	could  climax  over  and  over	from  being  bound  and
tormented.  She  learned  ass  fucking and got to enjoy it a great deal.  Heavy
nipple clamps and piercing were completely out for her, however she made up for
that minor oversight by mastering the ability to be fist fucked, only by Linda,
my hand was too big.  It was a remarkable sight to see her suspended, legs wide
apart, with Linda's hand inside her right up to the wrist,  twisting from right
to left.  It was truly one of Verna's highest moments.
.   Verna  took  quite well to candle wax,  but could never take it directly on
her nipples.  She preferred it on her ass and I  aim  to  please.  Linda  would
kneel  in front of me as I placed the hot wax on her nipples,  then place small
birthday candles in the wax and light them.  Linda would let them  burn  almost
all the way down and I would extinguish them with an ice cube.
.   During  those  days I would only fuck Verna in the ass.  I would let her do
oral service to me only in preparation for Linda.  It was only her cunt that  I
would  enter  and  only  her cunt I would eat.	Nothing Verna was willing to do
would distract me from Linda, she was mine and I wanted her to feel it.
.   One  evening Linda and I decided to use the cross on the wall for the first
time.  It was a rather awkward thing,  just two pieces of 2'x6' planks  secured
to  the wall in the shape of an 'X'.  Not really sure of what to use it for,  I
left it merely painted black.  At least it covered some of the wall and made an
interesting place to hang the occasional misplaced whip. While looking at it, I
got the idea of securing a person to it.  To this end I asked Verna to stand on
it for a measurement.
.   While Verna took a rest break,  I installed a series of screw  eyes  on the
outline of her approximate form on the cross.  When she awakened, I brought her
back  to  the  Cave  and asked her to resume the position I used for outlining.
With that we began to apply 1/8" nylon rope through the  eyes,  Linda  did  one
side and I the other.  Verna was securely fastened with ropes crisscrossing her
body  at  every 2" or so intervals.  She was well bound,  all but her tits.  It
seemed unfair to restrain those huge globes and I was  not  to	be  accused  of
being unfair.
.   We left her there for hours and in that time I  pleasured  Linda  over  and
over  again.  I  loved	the way she would wrap her legs around my neck and just
come over and over and over.  We then spent much time  in  a  69  position  and
finally I took her in the ass.	She screamed how she loved it,	she did.  Verna
finally spoke up saying "What about me?" and that pissed Linda off.
.   She  put a gag in her mouth and said she would brand her right on those big
bouncing tits.	I sat back in the chair to see how  far  she  would  go,  while
Verna  started	to  become  more than a little uncomfortable at the prospect of
being  branded.  Linda got out the charcoal and after opening the window a bit,
started a fire.  After about twenty minutes the coals  in  the	brassiere  were
glowing  a smooth grey ash.  She then put the irons in and watched for the next
half hour as they took on a cherry red glow.
.   Verna was starting to become a little panicky and began to	strain	at  her
bonds,	but it was no use,  I do good work.  But was this to be?  Was Verna  to
have  the  brand  of some ranch on those huge breasts just like some cow on the
range?	I had other ideas.
.   As Linda was getting ready to remove the first iron, I interrupted her with
a simple sentence "You cannot do that to her, if you are not willing to have it
done  to  you."  Linda  just  put  the  iron down and realized what she had let
herself in for.  There was no turning  back  ...  I  had  spoken.  She	had  to
prepare herself for the fate she had preordained,  so she bowed  her  head  and
just said "How do you want me, Master?"
.   I  put  her  in  her  usual  suspension  position.	Verna was still hanging
around, a bit wide-eyed at the whole event and obviously relieved she would not
be at the other end of those irons.  I wanted to reassure her, so I  came  over
and  gently and softly whispered to her "You're next." Her struggles were to no
avail  and  Linda  was sweating a little.  Had she finally bitten off more than
she could chew?
.   There was a bucket of ice next to my chair for several  reasons,  primarily
to keep drinks cold since the summer heat coupled with the additional heat from
the  charcoal was proving to be somewhat stifling ...  and for another purpose.
About half the ice had already melted and turned into water.  I removed  a  few
cubes,	went over to Verna and placed them on her nipples.  As the chill passed
through her body,  I reminded her that this was where the iron would fall.  She
struggled again, a total waste of time. "Relax and enjoy" I told her.
.   With  Linda  suspended  from  her wrists,  legs spread wide apart,	nipples
extended with the needles crossed in them from the thin wires from the ceiling,
I placed the ice right between her hair line and her belly button. "This is for
you" I whispered in her ear.  A look of fear came to her face and  she  started
to  protest  about  not there and stuff like that.  I felt it better to not run
the risk of confusing directions,  so I gagged her.  She  squirmed,  so  I  was
forced	to  place  another  rope around her waist and secure her to two points,
making it no longer possible for her to move.
.   With both prey well tethered I began.  First I re_EX  an  iron  from  the
fire  and  come  close	to  each of them,  asking each one who would like to be
first.	Even with the gags in place I could tell there were no volunteers,  the
choice	was  mine.  The  first iron was getting a little cool,	so for effect I
plunged it into the ice bucket.  The room filled with a smokey	steam  and  the
smell  of  fear  from both ladies.  "I can't bear the thought of having you see
this" I said as I blindfolded Verna.  Linda was sure  she  would  be  first.  I
took another iron,  walked over to her and let her feel the heat just above her
cunt.  She knew the spot was unchangeable.  "I don't think you should see  this
either"  I said as I blindfolded her.  She thrashed and squirmed,  but remained
secure.
.   I went back to the fire and got another iron.  I let Verna	feel  the  heat
from  a  few  inches  away and then carefully switched the iron in my left hand
with one from the ice bucket in my right hand.	As I placed the  cold  iron  on
Verna's  nipple,  she  let  out a muffled scream that went right through Linda.
Again on the other nipple and a similar reaction.
.   As I went to Linda I whispered in her ear "And now for you,  you  will  not
scream,  you  will  be	brave.	Soon  you  will  wear  my brand and you will be
completely mine." This seemed to calm her down,  but there was still a  lot  of
anxiety so she took a deep breath and nodded her readiness.
.   I took the hot iron and passed it near her cunt. "A little lower, I think."
This drove her into a frenzy.  I could tell that the muffled  cries  were  "No,
no,  no...."  She had gotten herself into this and I was not letting her out of
it.  As I touched her with the ice cold iron,  she climaxed intensely and  with
violent  spasms  passed  out.  As  I looked just above the hairline I saw a red
welt appear and then disappear before my eyes.	I  wished  Verna  had  seen  it
also,  but  I  was  the  only  one who did.  It was as if she had been actually
branded and then it vanished.  To this day I  have  not  been  able  to  either
replicate or explain it.  It remains a mystery to me.
.   Later Verna said the cold was a big shock to her,  but she knew it was cold
and  not  hot,  while Linda said she actually felt the burn.  I wasn't sure the
whole thing was such a great idea.
.   Verna left the next day to return to the  real  world.  We	needed	another
week  to  recuperate  before  work  and  I needed to figure out what had really
happened.

.			      Part - 5, Chapter -1
.
.   April 1983,  the weather was beautiful,  the sun was hot in the sky and the
weekends were to be enjoyed outdoors.  Linda was in the last half of her junior
year  and  doing  well,  I was proceeding with my Masters' Degree.  It had been
several months since either of us had heard from Verna and I liked it that way.
We had decided not to get married,  since there  seemed  to  be  no  compelling
reason  to  do  so.  With  Linda's  parents  gone her desire to change her name
seemed to fade and we were also talking much less about a third party  for  our
sessions, which had changed. After one of the piercing sessions Linda developed
a  small  infection,  nothing  serious,  but it took  several days to clear up,
so I had refrained from giving her that pleasure for fear of  reinfection.  She
understood and went along with my decision.  We made up for it in other ways.
.   Our use of the Cave had dwindled to once or twice a month.	There seemed to
be more softness between us now and she only needed the harshness on a periodic
basis.	I too was enjoying the softness and the time away from the Cave  tended
to  make  those  sessions much more meaningful.  She was more sensitive,  would
take less to start and then build to a more intense crescendo.
.   My former employer had an assignment for me,  so I was away for 2 days  and
nights.  I spent my time on a lamp post in Long Island,  while she remained  at
home waiting.  When I returned she was all over me like a bitch in heat.  These
were the first nights we had been apart in almost three years and neither of us
liked it.  We missed the next two days of work.
.   I was very proud of her and the progress she had made.  Away  from	me  she
had  become  more  aggressive and was not as easily pushed around.  She was now
running for the trains pulling out of the station,  driving  in  city  traffic,
taking	the  car  to  school and parking it on the street.  She had changed her
style of dress at the office to something  less  frilly  and  goody-goody.  Her
school	work was becoming less of a drudge and she was even hinting at going to
law school after college.  In short,  she had grown into an independent  person
and  I	was  pleased.  I felt I had helped a person to grow and that was a good
feeling.  In short, all was going well.
.   I took out my 45,  an Essex  framed model  of WWII vintage	that  had  been
completely  reworked  by an French gunsmith in Cambodia.  It was black chromed,
had Ivory grips with gold inlays and the action  was  stainless  steel.  I  had
carried  this  weapon for 6 1/2 years In-Country and had used it often.  It was
reliable.  I placed it in the shoulder holster and with my build could carry it
totally undetected.  I will admit I had become somewhat attached to it and with
the exception  of  my  daily  office  duties,  I  would  carry	it  everyplace,
especially  on	trips.	She  had a few objections to my carrying a weapon.  She
said if I had to carry it,  then she was afraid for me and if I did not have to
carry it,  she saw no reason for doing so.  I told her it was not her business.
.   Her  style of dress at the office had changed to skirts and blouses as well
as pants.  For this firm,  women wearing  pants  at  that  time  was  a  little
revolutionary,	although  I  thought  it made a lot of sense.  Her wardrobe for
casual wear was of two types,  leather or denim and she looked	spectacular  in
both.  I had started by buying her leather pants,  vests and jackets for riding
and then skirts and dresses.  Often times she would wear a very  short	leather
skirt  with only a vest and spike heels when we went riding,  causing many eyes
to turn when we came by.  She would also bring a leather dress to the office on
Fridays and change before she met me at the usual local hangout.  These dresses
were of one design ...	very tight and with a  zipper  going  down  the  front.
Often  she would leave the zipper a bit low,  which had a distracting effect on
many of my associates, but had an uplifting effect on me.
.   Once  I  was a little late meeting her after work,	so she waited for me at
the bar.  As usual there were a dozen or so guys hitting on her,  one  of  them
was  unfortunately my boss.  He approached her as she waited for me and started
the usual "come here often" boring conversation, which was enough to  illicit a
negative  reaction  from  anyone.  Then he proceeded to tell her how lovely she
was and said if she had been there before,  he would have certainly  remembered
her.  I can sympathize with her repugnance at this sort of drivle, but she kept
her  temper,  not  knowing  who  or what he was.  She told him politely she was
waiting for someone,  but my boss seemed to pay no attention to that.  He  came
on  strong and started questioning her about what would happen if she left with
him before her friend got there.  As I came in I could see what was  going  on,
so I hid behind one of the booths to overhear what they were saying ...  OK,  I
was  curious  as to how she would handle the situation.  He was pulling out all
the stops and finally she very cooly said "I belong completely to my Master and
would  have  it  no other way.	You would not have the slightest idea of how to
begin to satisfy me and I find the thought of being anyplace with  you	totally
repulsive.  Please  leave  me  alone or I cannot be responsible for your safety
when he shows up."
.   Oh shit, now I have a real problem,  but I had an idea of how to handle it.
"Linda, Dom" I said as I pretended to walk in.  She was very glad to see me, he
was  not.  "Is  your  wife  with  you?"  I  asked my boss.  At that he suddenly
realized there was nothing he could say about the putdown he had  just	gotten.
A  little  small talk and Linda looked at me whisperring,  just loud enough for
Dom to hear,  "Take me home to bed,  please?" We left momentarily and did  just
that.
.   The  only comments passed about that evening from my boss was "That's quite
a  little lady you've got there." I felt the outdated sexism in that remark and
a little twist in my gut at the thought of the old views of  women  dredged  up
from  the  distant  past of modern corporate America.  I did have to agree with
the thought though "quite a lady" and left it at that.
.   My former employer called again and  this  time  it  was  to  be  a  longer
assignment.  I	cleared  things  with my company and I was sent to Colorado for
three weeks.  After the first night I called in and told them to get Linda  out
here  or  the  job  was  off.  I  missed  her  so  much  that it hurt and I was
determined to have her with me. It was cleared with her company and she was out
there with me.	It felt so good to hold her and it seemed so long since I  last
had.  We stayed in a small house outside the main part of the city, in the East
we  call it Suburbia.  The job lasted five weeks and by the end of that time we
were both thoroughly disgusted with suburban living and all that went with  it.
Goodbye to  Mr. and Mrs. Henry Weber  and back to reality,  or at least back to
what we had grown to accept as reality.
.   It was July 4th weekend when we got back and a very long and solid	weekend
in the Cave brought us both back to normal.
.     ********************************************************************

.
.   By this time I had become concerned about several  things.	First,	we  had
not been with Verna,  or any other women, in quite a while and I sort of missed
it.  I did not want to encourage Linda to acquire any additional  partners  for
us,  since  I felt I wanted her more to myself but missed the combinations that
were possible with three.  I also missed having someone whom  I  did  not  care
about  to  treat  as I saw fit.  In retrospect it was this lack of concern that
allowed me to take both Linda and  Verna  higher  and  higher.	When  something
became too intense for Linda to handle, I would move over to Verna for balance.
This balance was missing.
.   Secondly,  I  was  worried  that Linda's capacity for the Cave events would
dwindle.  I had become harder on her and without the relief of a  third  party,
Linda  had  taken  more  than  ever.  She had completely enjoyed it,  but I had
second thoughts about our activities since we were spending more and more  time
in  the  Cave.	It  had  escalated  to	a session beginning on Friday night and
ending on Sunday afternoon.  She was always very sore and  tender  after  these
sessions and often had difficulty in sitting, moving and often concentrating on
Mondays.
.   Third,  since  the	discontinuance	of  the  nipple  piercing,  the  use of
alligator clips as nipple clamps had become standard.  Much tension was put  on
these  clamps  for very long periods of time.  She had withstood severe pain in
these sessions and had received incredibly  intense  levels  of  pleasure  from
them.
.   Forth,  I was pushing her further and further each time.  It seemed  to  me
her  limits  had  to  be  raised each time or it might not be enjoyable for me.
Many times she would beg for me to stop only  to  get  another	enema,	another
lash, or another notch on the winch.  Most of the time I knew she really didn't
want me to stop,  but there were those few times I was a little fuzzy about the
protests.  In reality there were times I did not care.
.   Fifth, her manner of dress on the outside had changed by my instruction and
I had begun buying all of her clothes, including her underwear.  We would go to
a department store, she would try on something, come out into the mirrored area
and then model for my approval.  Most of this was underwear and it was of great
embarrassment for her to do so in public.  Several times we were asked to leave
the store.  There was one department store in which the salesgirl was obviously
gay  and  had no objection to the endless parade of skimpy attire,  needless to
say we spent a lot of time and money in that store.  Much of the  remainder  of
her  wardrobe  was  leather,  I  had  gotten her about twenty skirts,  each one
shorter and tighter than the other.  The dresses were made to my specifications
and had either very deep necklines or  were  completely  backless.  The  skirts
were either red, electric blue, or black while the dresses were either black or
pastel	colors.  Often	I could not decide what I preferred her to wear,  since
she looked great in all of them.  Interestingly enough,  many of the designs  I
created  have  recently  appeared  on the cover of magazines like Cosmopolitan.
Perhaps I was a little before my time.
.   Lastly,  I had become obsessed about living out fantasies and expanding her
limits, which was the most destructive influence on  the  entire  relationship.
Perhaps  it  was  this	pushing that foretold the need for balance and if I had
listened to it then, much could have been avoided.

.			     Part - 5, Chapter -3
.
.   September,	1983 and the beginning of her last year in school.  Grades were
up and the end was in sight.  Assertiveness was high and to my way of thinking,
she had become a complete woman.  Several fantasies had been  conjured	up  and
noted  for  living  out at a later date.  They ran the gamut from very romantic
pirate and princess to a very brutal Spanish Inquisition type.	One stood  out.
In  the  northern  part  of  Boston six Portuguese sailors were found guilty of
raping a woman on a pool table in  a  bar.  For  some  reason  she  found  this
extremely  erotic  and	begged me to enact it with her,  so I sought to realize
this fantasy for her.  A friend of mine had  a	bar  on  Third	Street	in  the
Village,  near the Hell's Angel's clubhouse,  it had a pool table and he agreed
to let us use it after closing. Just before we could get everything coordinated
Verna came back into our lives.
.   She started by calling Linda at her office asking to have lunch  with  her.
I saw no reason they should not meet since they were friends, but made it clear
that  I did not want Verna to join us again.  Linda agreed and they had several
lunches together.  She finally asked me to talk with Verna to see if  we  could
patch  things  up for more sessions.  I will admit I sort of missed that chesty
little bitch and because of this I agreed to meet  with  her  to  'iron  things
out'.
.   The  meeting  was at my friend's bar late on Friday.  Linda and I got there
early, partially to check out the pool table and partially to relax and discuss
what we were going to say to Verna when she showed up.	It was a sleazy hangout
for bikers most of whom wore 'colors',  the denim  jackets  covered  with  gang
insignias  and various parches of significance to the individuals concerned.  I
was welcomed since I knew a few of the guys from my Army days.	Even  though  I
was an officer,  they all knew I was fair and treated my men decently.	Because
of that I was a welcomed patron.
.   That night there were about fifteen to twenty bikers and four  or  five  of
their  ol' ladies (the biker's equivalent to a steady girl).  The biggest was a
guy nicknamed 'Donkey' due to the size of his  cock,  which  rumor  had  it  at
fourteen  inches  long	and  seven and a half inches around.  He had no trouble
picking up the loose, and I do mean loose,  women in the place.  Donkey was six
feet nine inches tall and had avoided the draft by being too tall.  Remarkably,
he was one of the few who had not spent time in jail.  Clean living, I guess.
.   Midnight  came around and Verna showed up,	just on time.  She sat down and
ordered  a  drink,  straight  tequilla	with salt and lemon.  She knew this was
going to be rough and needed a bracer.
.   "I miss it" she said.
.   "What?" I asked.
.   "The two of you,  it is like nothing means  anything  without  you  two.  I
can't get myself to do anything with anybody.  I want back."
.   "Why?" I asked.
.   Linda  started  to	say  something and I cut her off just before she was to
utter the first sound.
.   "I'll handle this" I said in a very stern voice.
.   Verna  got	very  nervous,	probably  because she thought I was considering
something and partly since she did not want to blow it.  She really wanted back
and went on and on about how good we made her feel and how good she was for us.
She mentioned a philosophical dialogue in which she put  forth	the  fact  that
what  we did together was something the three of us had created and it would be
that much diminished by the lack of her participation.	She said we needed  her
to  push  those  limits and without her we would dwindle.  Verna also said once
you have been there,  it is very difficult to stay away.  She  went  over  some
highlights  of	the  many  sessions  we had and begged to return to those days.
Finally she said she would do anything to get it back  and  she  was  sorry  if
anything she had done had offended us.
.   Something that should be known about Verna was that until  she  was  thirty
years  old  she  was  a VIRGIN.  Unthinkable as it may sound,  her first sexual
experience was with us.  Oh well,  at least she started  right.  Since	we  had
her,  she  had	tried  to  have  several  relationships with men and found them
completely nonphysical.  It seemed I was the only guy who had ever  fucked  her
and for that matter, the only man who had ever done anything else to her.  When
she told me this, I became a bit unnerved.  I assumed she was at the very least
sexually  active and we had just expanded her horizons,  rather than taught her
everything she knew.  This effected me a  little,  afterall  it's  OK  to  play
around	with someone who has been around but not to deflower,  so to speak,  in
such an extreme way.  My instant reaction was that if  she  had  someone  else,
she would not need us.
.   I  thought about it for a while.  Every time either Verna or Linda tried to
say something,	I raised my hand in a gesture of silence and,  needless to say,
they both obeyed.  I thought perhaps a small test would be in  order  to  prove
Verna's desire to return,  since at times I felt she was with us because it was
easier than going out on her own and finding someone  for  herself.  Yes,  that
was it.  A test...
.   "What will you do to get back?" I mused.
.   "Anything you want, I'll move in with you and take care of the place, cook,
clean, anything, but let me back."
.   "Anything I want?"
.   "Anything!"
.   "OK, do every guy and girl in this place."
.   The silence was deafening.
.   Linda looked at me and said "NO".
.   "Shutup or I'll turn you out too."
.   She froze ... suddenly the realization of Verna's return and the reality of
the  harshness of the test were too much for her to deal with.	She did not say
another word.
.   I stood up and made the announcement to the general public that Verna was a
bitch in heat and bragged she could take on this entire bar ...  right there on
the pool table.  I made her stand up, unbutton her blouse and remove her bra.
.   "Here she is guys, do her."
.   And they did.  Donkey was first.  A little head and  then  in  the	ass.  A
little	more head and then in the cunt.  And so on and so on.  Two of the girls
got into the act by giving Verna's oral talents a workout.
.   5:45am came and Verna had gone through thirteen guys  and  two  girls.  She
was  exhausted	and  it  was a great show.  Linda and I got up and as we left I
said to Verna "Better luck next time".  After all I had said ALL!
.     ********************************************************************

.
.   Linda was very upset about the incident with Verna and said it wasn't fair.
I  kept  reminding  her  Verna had not met the requirements of the position and
failing fulfillment of the agreed upon contract, removed me from any obligation
to let her back.  And besides, she probably enjoyed it.  We did not see or hear
from Verna for quite a while.
.   Linda had eased off the pool table fantasy until a movie came on television
about a girl being raped.  This seemed to really turn her on,  so  she	revived
the   idea.   I  agreed  to  go  through  with	it  and  made  the  appropriate
preparations.  It seems the girl was raped at knife point and  had  her  wrists
tied  with a pair of stockings while the assailant wore a ski mask.  To make it
as real as possible I purchased a Buck General 7" bowie knife  and  for  safety
dulled	the  blade so there would be no possibility of cutting her.  The search
for a ski mask was more extensive,  since all  I  could  find  were  ones  that
itched.  Finally I found one and made the arrangement for Monday night, the day
when the bar was closed.  It cost me $500 to bribe the owner,  but I thought it
was worth it.
.   The Saturday before the planned rape we were assailed by  friends  of  mine
from the office with tickets to the ballet,  which to my way of thinking is the
second most boring thing after watching turtle races.  Unfortunately it  was  a
reciprocal evening out, so we were socially obligated to go.  I have completely
repressed what we saw on stage,  partially due to the massive amounts of coffee
I had to drink to stay awake and partially because I can't stand the  sight  of
men in tights.	Mercifully it was over and we left.
.   We got to the sidewalk and decided to go to a jazz club in the  Village  to
clear  my  head.  I needed to remove the hideous sounds that had seemed to take
root on my ears lest they remain permanently.  Linda  had  driven  in,	so  she
offered to get the car.  I stayed with the other couple and made small talk.
.   A  few  minutes passed and all of a sudden I had a thought.  "Shit" I said,
as I ran down the block toward the garage.  I rounded  the corner  and	started
to  where the car was when I heard a muffled scream from her.  As I got there I
saw what was happening.  The man, a black, 19 to 20 years old,  5'10", 155 lbs,
wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, had her against the car. He had a knife to  her
throat	and  his hand over her mouth.  Her blouse was torn and her breasts were
exposed.
.   I told him to stop.  He turned and held her in front of  himself  with  the
knife to her throat, indicating in what he assumed to be understandable English
that he would cut her if I didn't remove myself from the garage.  This prompted
a reflex action on my part,  I drew the 45 firing three times.	The first round
caught him in the right eye taking off about three quarters of his skull, while
the second and third rounds caught him in the right shoulder and just above the
adam's apple.  The second two didn't matter, he was dead after the first.
.   The impact forced him back about three feet and left Linda	standing  there
covered  with  blood  and bone fragments.  She froze,  went into shock and then
became hysterical,  yelling and screaming.  I tried to calm  her  down,  but  a
policeman heard her and came in.  I asked him to call an ambulance and the duty
Captain.
.   The  ambulance  arrived in less than two minutes and the attendants sedated
her.  By this time the officer had noticed the garbage in the  corner.	I  told
him  I	would speak to the duty Captain and I was not leaving.	He was not sure
what to do, so he waited.
.   The Captain got there,  I produced the correct permits for the  weapon  and
after  a  few minutes of preliminary investigation and a couple of phone calls,
he let me go to the hospital with Linda.  She spent three days recovering  from
the  incident  and  I  spent  four  days filling out reports.  For some unknown
reason when you exterminate vermin there is an avalanche of  paper  to	explain
it, but if the vermin gets away with his act there is a simple victim's report.
Something I could never understand.
.   Oh yes, she never mentioned the pool table again and I did not bring it up.

.
.   We	both recovered from the incident without much ado.  She had been pretty
spooked about going anyplace alone for a while, but got over it rather well.  I
was a little upset that I was forced to use a weapon  from  the  jungles  in  a
civilized  area.  I  had  a reluctance to carry it for a while until I realized
what would have happened if I had not had it with me.
.   Both of us withdrew into our own little shells and waited out the dispersal
of any guilt over the happening.  I never learned the victim's name,  only that
he  had  about	20  outstanding  warrants for similar crimes and had killed two
women in that same garage over the  previous  six  months.  After  the	initial
paperwork,  I  was never asked to participate in any further legal actions.  It
seemed that everybody was glad he was dead,  everybody except me.  At  first  I
blamed	Linda  for  going  down there alone,  then I blamed myself for being so
stupid as to let her go and then it got back to blaming Linda  for  needing  to
become	aggressive  and  the driving thing to bring that about.  Back and forth
it went for weeks, until I finally let it go.  Funny, I had never thought about
anybody else I had killed, what made this street kid any different?
.   Linda  seemed to develop a real problem about being out of the apartment at
night.	I understood and since it was the beginning of her last semester and  I
was  still attending for my Master's Degree,  I arranged my schedule so I would
be able to drop her off and pick her up from classes.  She felt better with  me
around and I was reassured of her safety.
.   On the semester break we decided to get away for a while.  Up to Vermont to
an out of the way hotel for ten days of rest and relaxation.
.   Problems  began  on the first night.  After the six hour drive we were both
pretty tired,  but  that  never  stopped  us  before.  Something  very	strange
happened ... Linda was afraid to make love in a strange setting.  I told her it
was  OK  and she should get some sleep.  She couldn't do that,  for some reason
she was terrified to stay there.  We left at 3:40am and drove back  home.  From
then  on  she  would  go nowhere if we could not get back home by bedtime.  She
would not discuss it and was afraid to stay anywhere.  I figured it would  pass
and let it go.
.   School was winding down and it had become obvious  she  was  graduating  in
June.  Easter  passed  and it was the home stretch.  It had become obvious that
Linda was not going to sleep anywhere away from  home,	so  plans  for	a  long
summer	vacation  had  to  be  scrapped.  I  considered going without her,  but
thought better of it.
.   Graduation came and I gave her an 18k solid gold school ring.  She wore  it
on  her  right	hand  and the diamond on her left.  Sometimes I would catch her
looking  at  her  hand	with  the school ring,	she was so thrilled with it and
treasured everything it meant.	I was proud of her and let her know it.
.   Our sessions in the Cave had picked up and were getting longer and	longer.
After  school ended it occupied most of our spare time and I was running out of
ideas.	It seemed I had done everything possible with her that could  be  done,
until I got an idea ...  fear,	the final frontier.  I knew she was afraid of a
few things,  most of which could not be created without a lot of effort, things
like nuclear war,  earthquakes,  plane crashes,  big fires and the like.  These
were fears,  however,  I did not feel she should have to confront in  order  to
push  her  limits  further.  Somewhere	I  had	heard if you look at a fear and
experience it,	then it will no longer	be  a  fear.  Well  the  order	of  the
universe  need  not  be disrupted for an evening's adventure and thought of one
thing I could experiment with.	She was terrified of spiders.  OK, that was it.
.   I went to a local pet shop,  purchased three large spiders and was	assured
by the clerk they were not poisonous. I told him they were a gift for a 10 year
old  nephew  and  I  did not want the kid to croak.  I brought them home in the
little box.
.   That night I suspended Linda by her wrists and  also  her  ankles,	so  she
really could not move.	She was wearing her usual outfit, the spike heel boots,
stockings  and	leather  garter  belt.	Nipple	clamps	had  been  left off for
tonight.  After a little candle wax on her stomach and	shoulders,  I  put  her
hair in a ponytail and told her I had a surprise for her.  I put the gag in her
mouth  and  petted  her gently.  I told her it would be all right and there was
nothing to worry about,  I was about to free her from  an  old	fear.  I  still
remember the look of complete trust she had as she gazed at me.
.   I  showed  her  the spiders and she started to flinch.  She convulsed a bit
and then seemed to settle down	a  little.  She  stared  at  the  little  clear
plastic box and started to sweat.  I could tell she did not like me putting the
blindfold  on.	I kept describing the little eight-legged creatures and finally
let one out on her soft skin.  She flinched  twice  and  then  tensed  all  her
muscles  in  a	last  attempt  to stop this.  I released the other two and they
started to climb up from her thighs toward her love  nest.  They  both	stopped
just south of her lovely bush and stayed there,  while the first one had gotten
to the space between her breasts.
.   She was not responding,  so I assumed  one	of  two  things  had  happened.
Either	she  could not feel them or she did not believe they were really there.
They were the largest spiders I could find,  so I concluded she didn't  believe
what was happening.  When I asked her if she wanted the blindfold off,	she did
not respond,  but that changed when I removed it.  The look  in  her  eyes  was
rather	intense and she started shaking and really sweating.  Yes,  the spiders
were real. They walked over her for about twenty minutes more and then I felt I
had to remove them.
.   I  put  them away and gently let her down.	She clung to me with a strength
that belied her size.  I removed the gag and she started to mumble "No more, no
more.....".  I held her for several hours and was very gentle with her for  the
rest of the night.  After all,	she had just had her first real experience with
terror and that can be a little un-nerving.
