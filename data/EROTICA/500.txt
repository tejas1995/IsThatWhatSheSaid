Bad Timing  (full version)

The dim light of the computer monitor cast an eerie light across the 
otherwise dark room.  My head turned frequently toward the 
staircase behind me to make sure that nobody was coming.  With 
my heart pumping at a hundred miles per hour, it was difficult to 
focus on the task before me.  My sweaty hand trembled as I placed 
the next data cartridge into the laser tape drive.  This was the fifth 
one . . . "God I hope this is it" I thought.  As the machine whirred, 
the cartridge index appeared on the screen.  1) Last Wi. . . . . . 
"Ahh . . . yes!  Here you are."  I quickly toggled to the data base 
launch menu . . . entered the encrypted security password . . . and 
kept my fingers crossed.  The screen flashed "Security Password 
Verified" . . . "Welcome Mr. Starr".  I quickly started scanning the 
document . . . looking for . . . "There we go! Found it!".   "One 
word.  I just have to change one word" I mumbled.  "There we go . 
. . done".   I hit the save icon and then manually revised the 
date/time stamp on the file so as not to arouse any suspicion.  
"Come on baby . . . hurry up and save . . . hurry up and save".  I 
ejected the cartridge and placed it back in it's case.  As I hurriedly 
reached to place it back on the shelf, my elbow bumped the edge of 
a stack of books.  Thud!!!  "God damn it!!!" I said under my breath 
as one of the books fell to the floor.  "Fuck!  Come on now . . . 
stay calm . . . stay calm".  I quickly placed the fallen book back on 
top of the stack and straightened it out.  I turned around to look up 
the stairs to see if anyone had heard anything.  "Shit . . . a light!"
"Hello?" a voice rang out from upstairs.  "Is anyone there?"  There 
was a long pause and then . . . "Call the police Lisa, I think that 
there's someone downstairs . . . I'll get the gun."
"Shit!  He's coming!"  I thought.  I spun around and turned off the 
computer.  As the stairwell lights turned on, I looked down at my 
wrist and pressed the glowing amber "return" button on the remote 
command unit.  The space around me wavered and warped as my 
body evaporated back into the time space continuum.  In a flash, I 
was gone.  I was hoping that my presence went undetected.  But 
there was no way of knowing . . . except to let time take its course.

Again the atmosphere quivered around me.  Slowly, my vision 
cleared as the Alpha Command Research Center began to 
materialize around me.  I slumped to the floor, drained of all my 
energy. . . my blood racing through my veins from an adrenaline 
high.
"You all right soldier?!" A voice rang out.
"Yeah . . . I'm fine. Just give me a minute." I replied.  "I had a bit 
of a rough ride this time." 
The image of my commanding officer, Captain Wilcox, came into 
focus.  "Well . . . were you successful lieutenant?  Were you able 
to get an ID on the assassin?  Did you see who actually shot 
President Kennedy!?"
"No sir."  I replied.  "I'm sorry, but there was no way for me to get 
into the building without being seen.  I didn't want to breach the 
First Directive sir.  I had to abort."
"Damn it!  We've been so close the past couple of attempts.  Shit!"  
He raised his head for a moment and tried to regain  his 
composure.  "All right Starr . . . good effort . . . we'll get it the 
next time.  Get on over to debriefing."  He saluted me, turned and 
left the room.

As he shut the door, I started to chuckle to myself.  "Ahh . . . if 
they only knew what I'd just done!"  I thought.  "Hell, I can hardly 
believe I went through with it.  If anyone ever found out, I'd be  
thrown out of the program and court-martialed for sure."
"Please stand up sir." Another voice said.  Three men in sealed 
yellow suits hurried over and began to hose me down with a 
gaseous mixture intended to reestablish my atomic structure.  "God 
this stuff fucking stinks."  I thought.  "But certainly a small price 
to pay to be a millionaire for the rest of my life!"  A smirk of 
satisfaction came across my face as I stood there dreaming of all 
the possibilities.

My name is Stephan Starr.  And as a secret member of the army's 
first Time / Research Unit, I'd just pulled one hell of a fast one.  
Not only on my superiors, but on my stinking family as well.  
Please allow me to explain . . .This all started 5 days ago.  The day 
my father passed away.  For most people, the passing of a parent is 
a pretty traumatic event.  But in my case, I was hardly phased.  In 
fact, I was actually kind of excited in a perverse sort of way.  You 
see . . . I was never really close with my father.  And since mom 
had passed away a couple of years ago, my relationship with my 
dad had only gotten worse.  But somehow I managed to put up a 
pretty convincing front to my true feelings.  After all, the only thing 
I was really concerned about was my inheritance.  The old man 
was worth millions, and with me and my ass kissing brother being 
the only surviving immediate family members . . . well . . . I'd 
probably never have to work another day in my life.  Or at least . . 
. that's what I thought.

May 6, 2079 - 1:01 PM

Two days ago on a dreary Wednesday, my brother John and I met 
in a lawyers office to go over my father Last Will and Testament.  
"Hello Stephan."  John said as I entered the room.  "I should have 
known that you wouldn't be late for this."
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?!"  I shot back in disgust.
John said "Please spare me.  You can drop your act now.  Dad's 
gone and you're probably thrilled to death.  All you've ever given a 
damn about is yourself . . . and all you've ever cared about is 
money!"
"Why you fucking . . . "  I screamed as I lunged toward him.
"Gentleman!  Please . . . Please!"  the lawyer barked.  "There's 
nothing to be gained by all of this . . . please . . . lets put the 
differences aside.  If not permanently, at least for the next half hour 
or so.  We have business to attend to."
We managed to pull ourselves together for the brief task at hand.  
"One day . . ." I thought.  "that ass was going to get his.  I swear 
it!"

The tension was broken was the sight of the laser cartridge being 
placed on the desk in front of us.
"As you both know, this cartridge has been in secure storage at 
The National Record Keeping Bureau for the past 25 years.  It was 
placed into storage by your father on July 23, 2054.  It was tagged 
as his Last Will and Testament, and was intended to be read by his 
surviving immediate family upon his death.  This cartridge has 
been certified as both authentic and unaltered by the Bureau.  Here 
is the certificate of authenticity for your examination."
He placed a green official looking certificate on his desk in front of 
us.
"So . . . if neither of you have any questions, I'd like to 
commence."
"Let's get on with it."  I said.
John nodded his head in agreement.
The lawyer placed the cartridge in his computer and pressed a few 
buttons.  I noticed him type in the security password "g56y7k" . . . 
and in a few moments, his printer began to spit out three hard 
copies of the Will.  As he began to read aloud from the beginning 
of this 50 plus page document, I could hardly contain myself  from 
looking ahead to get to the part that really mattered.  After what 
seemed like an eternity, we were finally there.
The lawyer continued to read . . . "As for my monetary 
possessions.  They are to go solely and entirely to my spouse if still 
living.  If not, they are to be given solely and entirely to my oldest 
son . . ."
My heart seemed to skip a beat.  I did a double take.  "Wait a 
minute!  This can't be!" I yelled.  "What the hell is going on 
here?!"
"I'm sorry sir . . . I'm only reading what's here before me." the 
lawyer said.
"He has TWO sons . . . what's this OLDEST shit!!  There must be 
some mistake!"  I yelled.
"Please sir.  Lets just remain calm until we finish reading the entire 
document. We can go over the specifics later if you like."
"Fuck that!!"  I said.  I want to know what the hell kind of farce 
this is."  My eyes looked over at John and glared.  "You . . . you . . 
. you did this."
"Stephan, what are you talking about?!" John replied.  "How could 
I have done anything.  The damn thing's been locked up for twenty 
some years!  Maybe Dad just forgot to update it after you were 
born or something."  A smug look came across his face.  "Isn't it 
ironic though how things just seem to work out . . . kind of poetic 
justice in a way!  Don't you think?"
"You fucking son of a bitch!" I screamed.  The rest was just a blur.  
The next thing I remember, I was back at my apartment with a 
bottle of Tequila in my hand.

May 7, 2079 - 6:40 AM

I awoke early the next morning with one hell of a hang over.  I 
could hardly believe what had happened yesterday.  My entire life 
was ruined, and my brother . . . my fucking brother was laughing 
his ass off at me.  I didn't understand it.  Dad had submitted that 
will before I was born.  But yet he had assured me years ago that 
he had updated it to include us both.  Somehow I knew that John 
had to be involved in this.  Perhaps he switched them or . . . I don't 
know!  Fuck . . . all that matters now is that dad's updated Will 
never made it into "The Bureau" for storage . . . this outdated 
version is all that fucking matters now!  I buried my head in my 
pillow, deep in despair. A few moments later, the sound of my 
alarm clock shook me out of it.  I glanced over at the clock.  "Shit!  
Gotta get over to the base.  I've got to snap out of this.  I've got a 
`prep briefing' for an upcoming mission in a couple of days."  And 
then it hit me like a ton of bricks . . . 
An idea that was nothing more than brilliant.  An idea so good that 
I broke out laughing . . . hardly able to contain myself.
"That son of a bitch thinks he can screw me does he . . . well . . . 
lets see who gets screwed now!"  I got up, took some aspirin, 
showered, shaved, put on my uniform and headed off to the base.

During the drive there, I put some thought into my new plan.  "All 
right Stephan, think man . . . think".  Everything needed to be 
perfect.  "OK.  All I have to do is to change the date, time, and 
location on my remote command unit to read the night before my 
dad's first Will was submitted to "The Bureau".  Since the remote 
command unit is preprogrammed and is the only piece of 
equipment responsible for my destination, I should have no 
problem traveling to a different destination without detection.  
After all, technology had not yet discovered a way to monitor a 
persons' location as they traveled in time.  All I really need to do is 
to come up with some way that I can reprogram the remote 
command unit without being noticed and pray that nobody decides 
to recheck the settings before de-materialization."  Time flew by as 
I agonized over every detail.  Before I knew it, I was at the base.
The guard (Private Johnson) at the checkpoint religiously walked 
out to greet my car as he had done time and time again.  "Good 
morning Lieutenant." the Private said.
"Good morning." I replied.
"May I see your security clearance pass sir?"  he asked.
"Sure.  Here you go."  I flashed him my laminated ID badge 
clipped to the pocket of my shirt.  For what seemed like the 
millionth time, he leaned over to take a glance.
"Thank you sir.  All clear."  He signaled to the other guard inside 
as the gate began to rise.  He saluted me as I began to drive on.

Before me was Fort Williams, a small army base located just 
outside of Virginia Beach.  I was headed to the Alpha Four Five 
Research Center, some 8 levels below the main complex.  A 
research center so secret, that not even the White House knew of 
its' existence.  Financed solely through the Defense Department, it 
was the country's only facility dedicated solely to the exploration 
of time travel.  For the past fifty years or so, the government had 
been running this experimental program with the hopes of one day  
realizing their goal.   Well, that goal was achieved three years ago.  
And for the past two years, I've been  one of three `Time Walkers' 
who got to ride shotgun on one hell of a crazy ride.  Currently our 
missions were dedicated to researching historical events of the past.  
But we all knew that it was no more than a front in case the 
program was ever discovered.  The Pentagon sure as hell wasn't 
going to spend billions of dollars on a historical research program . 
. . that is unless that program might be able to be used to our 
advantage in a time of war.  But for now, we were just getting our 
feet wet and earning our stripes . . . studying the effects of time 
travel and understanding the ramifications of our actions in the 
past.  We had three `Directives' to abide by.  Each with it own dire 
set of potential consequences if broken. They were as follows:

1)  Observe only.  Remain inconspicuous and undiscovered.
2)  Never alter anything tangible.  The time line must remain 
unbroken and unchanged.
3)  When in doubt.  Abort the mission.

To this date, nobody had ever breached one, and I sure as hell 
didn't want to be the first.  It was a crazy job with a lot of risks, 
but hey, someone had to do it.

I spent the next few hours in a mission briefing.  My intended goal 
was to travel back to 1964 to observe the assassination of 
President John F. Kennedy.  Thus finally shedding some light on 
the remaining mysteries of his death.  As the details of the mission 
were laid out before me, my mind seemed to wander off in another 
direction.  Before the briefing was dismissed, I was informed that 
the mission was to be moved up one day.  I was to report back to 
the base at 9:00 PM tomorrow evening . . . de-materialization 
would be at 11:30 PM (it was found through trial and error that 
time travel was more accurate if executed during the cooler evening 
temperatures).  I was given some additional reading materials and 
dismissed from the meeting.
"Get some rest soldier . . . tomorrow is an important day." Captain 
Wilcox said.
"Yes sir" I responded.  "See you tomorrow".

I drove over to my gym for a light workout and then headed back 
home.  Later that evening I gave my brother a call . . . almost as if 
to give him one last chance to split things with me . . . but really 
just to enjoy his `attitude' one last time before I changed his life 
forever.  As expected, he was an arrogant asshole.  If not already, 
talking to him just further solidified my plan in stone.  Nothing was 
going to change my mind now.

May 8, 2079 - 6:45 AM

The next day went rather quickly.  I left the house at around 
7:30AM and spent the entire day running around doing a bunch of 
errands.  It was a good thing that I had a lot of things to do.  I was 
so nervous that it helped take my mind off things.  The day flew by 
as I never returned home, and before I knew it, it was time to get 
over to the base.  I approached the checkpoint and rolled my 
window down.  This time neither of the men came out to my car, in 
fact, I only saw one.  Private Johnson sitting in the window.
"You can go on through sir" he yelled to me from inside.
"You're not going to check my badge tonight?" I replied.
"Not tonight sir if you don't mind . . . I twisted my knee this 
afternoon and I'm having a hard time getting around right now" He 
said.
I saluted as the gate raised before me.
"That's amazing!" I thought.  "I didn't think that there was 
anything that could EVER stop him from coming out to my car and 
checking my ID . . . oh well . . . there's a first time for everything."  
I thought nothing of it and drove onward.

The preparation process was rather simple and before you knew it, 
it was time to put on `the silver suit'.  This special time travel suit 
and all of its' components were made of some type of experimental 
nickel alloy.  It seemed that it was the only element able to be 
teleported back through time other than flesh and blood.  I took the 
suit into the changing room and striped off all of my clothes.  In a 
matter of moments I had the suit on and zipped up.  My heart 
pounded as my right hand reached down toward the remote 
command module on my left wrist.  I paused for a moment and 
then typed in the date of July 22, 2054 - 11:45 PM.  As for the 
location, I entered in the computer generated latitude and longitude 
of the basement of my parents home in Philadelphia PA.  God help 
me if I was caught.  I stepped out of the room and headed over 
toward the de-materialization point.  Numerous technicians filled 
the room going over safety check lists and monitoring all of the 
systems.
"You ready soldier?" Captain Wilcox asked.
"Ready as ever sir." I replied.
I put on my helmet and stepped onto the de-materialization 
platform.  As the lights in the room dimmed, clouds of dry ice 
(intended to lower the air temperature around me) were billowed 
over me from several pipes located above my head.  Various lasers 
cut through the mist and scanned my body . . . entering every 
coordinate into the computer.
"Initiate countdown sequence!" the Captain barked.
The room lit up like a Christmas tree as a computer generated 
voice started to countdown.
"De-materialization in T-minus 10 seconds.  Mark.  10 . . . 9 . . . 8 
. . . 7 . . . 6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . 0 . . .
initiate de-materialization."
I pressed the glowing green button on my wrist, and 
instantaneously, the world around began to twist and warp.  With a 
quick flash of light . . . I was gone.

May 8, 2079 - 11:31 PM

Seconds later, the atmosphere in the room began to quiver once 
more.  I had completed my little `plan' and was re-materializing 
back in my own time.  I slumped to the floor.  "Mission Complete."  
I thought.
"You all right soldier?!" A voice rang out.
"Yeah . . . I'm fine. Just give me a minute." I replied.  "I had a bit 
of a rough ride this time." 
The image of my commanding officer, Captain Wilcox, came into 
focus.  "Well . . . were you successful lieutenant?  Were you able 
to get an ID on the assassin?  Did you see who actually shot 
President Kennedy!?"
"No sir."  I replied.  "I'm sorry, but there was no way for me to get 
into the building without being seen.  I didn't want to breach the 
First Directive sir.  I had to abort."
"Damn it!  We've been so close the past couple of attempts.  Shit!"  
He raised his head for a moment and tried to regain  his 
composure.  "All right Starr . . . good effort . . . we'll get it the 
next time.  Get on over to debriefing."  He saluted me, turned and 
left the room.

May 9, 2079 - 3:21 PM

It was so late when I finally got home that there was nothing I 
could do to see if my mission had been a success.  So, I tried to 
calm myself down and get some sleep.  "This should be one hell of 
a day!" I thought.  "At this very moment . . . I should be a 
millionaire!"  I laughed myself to sleep thinking  "My only regret is 
that I couldn't have again been in the lawyers office a couple of 
days ago to see the expression on John's face when the REVISED 
passage was read!"

You see, I had just traveled back in time to alter my fathers' Last 
Will and Testament.  Albeit the version that was intended to be 
replaced by my father, but the version that actually made it to the 
lawyers office after my brother did his meddling.  If all went right, 
two days ago, that stinking lawyer should have quoted the 
following from my fathers' Will . . .
"As for my monetary possessions.  They are to go solely and 
entirely to my spouse if still living.  If not, they are to be given 
solely and entirely to my YOUNGEST son . . ."  John would be 
left out entirely.  Everything will have come to me instead!  It was 
simply a stroke of genius.

May 9, 2079 - 10:59 AM

I awoke slowly with another monumental headache.  Nothing out 
of the ordinary, it was pretty typical to feel like shit after a mission.  
But this time for some strange reason, my body felt as though it 
had been run over by a truck.  I stumbled into the bathroom , took 
a leak, and stepped into the shower.  The hot water felt great as it 
flowed over my face and body.  I rubbed my face and eyes in an 
effort to wake up.  "Ouch!" I said.  I had just poked myself in the 
eye with a nail.  I looked down at my fingers.  "Shit . . . I didn't 
realize they were getting quite that long."  I went back to showering 
thinking nothing of it.  After toweling off, I clipped my nails, dried 
my hair and brushed my teeth.  I turned around to close the shower 
curtain and was startled by the amount of body hair left on the 
floor of the shower.  I turned on the water and rinsed it out.

Now that I was fully revived from my deep sleep, I decided that it 
was time to give John a call and check out my handiwork.  
"Hmmm, lets see . . . what day is it?  Oh yeah.  Saturday."  I could 
hardly stand it much longer.  The phone rang several times until 
finally it picked up . . . "Hi, you've reached 587-67 . . ."  Click.  I 
hung up.
"Damn it!  It figures that the son of a bitch wouldn't be in . . . I'll 
have to call him later."  I said.
I was really disappointed.  I had to get a hold of him . . . there was 
just no other way to check things out . . . or was there.
"Wait a minute.  I had a copy of the Will left over from my 
meeting at the lawyers office the other day.  Now where the hell did 
I put it?"
After rummaging around a bit, I finally found it wadded up in the 
trash can under my desk.
"Well, that's not a good sign."  I thought somberly to myself.  My 
heat raced as I began to straighten it out.  I turned to the 
appropriate page and closed my eyes for a moment.  "OK . . . here 
we go . . . keep your fingers crossed."
I opened my eyes and scanned for the appropriate text.  I read 
aloud.
"As for my monetary possessions.  They are to go solely and 
entirely to my spouse if still living.  If not, they are to be given 
solely and entirely to my YOUNGEST son . . ."  I screamed with 
joy as I threw the papers into the air.  "I did it!  I fucking did it!" I 
yelled.  "I really can't wait to find John now." I thought.

I had so much energy that I didn't know how I'd sit still until John 
got home.  I decided that I'd head out to the gym and work off 
some extra steam, come back in a couple of hours and get a hold of 
him then.  I threw some workout clothes together and started to get 
dressed.  When I opened my dresser drawer, I found quite a little 
surprise.  "What? . . . where the hell did these come from?" I 
thought as I held up a pair of skimpy black satin panties.  "How 
did they get in with my stuff?"  I wondered.  "I guess it must have 
gotten mixed up with my clothes downstairs in the laundry room."  
I threw it on the dresser top and went back to getting dressed.  I 
slipped on a pair of jockey shorts, sweat pants, tee and sweat shirt 
and was ready to go.  I grabbed my duffel bag and was off.

The drive went quickly as I joyfully sang out loud with the radio.  I 
could only daydream of what to do with my millions.  "Today is 
one hell of a day!"  I thought.  After parking, I grabbed my things 
and went inside.  There I presented my membership card and 
drivers license to the beautiful young attendant sitting at the front 
desk.
"Good day Mr. . . Starr" she said as she gazed at my drivers 
license.  "You may want to get this fixed" she said as she gave it 
back to me.  "Looks like you've got a `typo' on your license.  
Unless of course you're Ms. Stephan Starr!" she chuckled.
"What?" I replied as I took the license to see for myself.
"Well.  I guess you're right.  I've never noticed that before.  Thank 
you."  I said as I put it back in my wallet. "Have a nice day 
ma'am."
"You too Ms. Starr." She said laughing and giving me a smile.
I turned and headed off toward the locker room.

After changing, I went out to the `nautilus' equipment and did 
some stretching to get ready to do my `circuit'.  The first few 
machines seemed to be much more difficult than usual for me.  I 
felt like I had a lot of energy, but for some reason, everything was 
such a labor.  After 10 reps on the rowing machine, I was 
completely out of breath and sweating up a storm.  "Wow." I 
thought.  "I must be more wiped out than I thought from 
yesterday."  I got off and rested a minute before adjusting the seat 
and sitting down on the butterfly machine.  When I sat down, I 
noticed that the bars were a little higher than usual for me.  "I 
always have the seat on the third peg . . . "   I got off and moved 
the seat up one more peg.  "There. That's better." I grumbled.  As I 
began to do my first rep, I strained with all my might to squeeze 
the two bars together.  I released them and sat there bewildered for 
a moment.  "What the fuck?" I thought.  "I guess it's just not my 
day for working out.  Screw it.  I'm just gonna take a shower and 
get on home."

I staggered into the locker room, sat down on the bench and 
collected myself for a second before stripping and heading into the 
showers.  The cool water felt great over my quivering body.  As I 
washed, I noticed a lot of body hair sticking to my soap bar.  "This 
is really weird." I said to myself.  "I wonder if something happened 
to me on my last jump . . . I'd better get into the base and see `the 
doc' sometime this afternoon."  I dismissed it and went back to 
washing my face and hair.  Back at my locker, I dried off and 
began to get dressed.  As I was putting on my clothes, my eyes 
happened to glance over at some guy getting dressed across the 
room from me.  I was surprised that I noticed how well endowed he 
happened to be.  "That guy's hung like a horse!" I thought.  Then I 
shook my head quickly, as if to snap myself out of it.  I finished 
getting dressed, and headed out past the front desk to go to my car.
"Have a nice afternoon Ms. Starr."  The same girl behind the desk 
said in a matter of fact way.
I just froze for a moment and then continued on my way.

I was really looking forward to giving John a call.  Reveling in his 
misfortune would certainly snap me out of this `Twilight Zone' 
type day that I'd been having.  As I drove along the freeway,  my 
mind again wandered off, thinking of ways that I could spend my 
new fortune.  And soon enough, I had completely forgotten about 
my unsettling morning at the gym.  When I arrived at the 
apartment, I threw my duffel down on the floor and ran over to the 
phone.  Just before I got to the bedroom, I tripped over my sweat 
pant leg and went tumbling to the floor.  Without thinking much 
about it, I got up, sat on the bed and started dialing the phone.  My 
long nails clicked on the buttons as I dialed.  "Damn . . . I thought I 
just clipped these this morning."  After a couple of rings he picked 
up.
"Hello?" John said.
"Hi John.  It's me" I replied
"Hey . . . how are you doing? I was worried about you. I hadn't 
heard from you in a couple of days.  It seemed like you took the 
news pretty hard." he said.
"News?" I said "What news are you talking about John?"
"Come on Steph . . . about being left out of dads Will.  Surly you 
didn't forget!"  he said.
"Wait a minute.  I got a copy of it here.  He didn't leave me out!"  I 
said in defiance.
"Look . . . we went over this Steph . . . the Will said the youngest 
son.  But that does mean . . . youngest son . . . not the youngest in 
the family." he stated.
"But . . . what?  But I'm the youngest son and . . . what's with this 
Steph stuff anyway?!" I demanded.
"Hey, have you been drinking or something Steph?  Are you all 
right?"  John asked.
I was so furious that I just hung up the phone.
"I've got to get over to his house and figure out what the hell 
happened." I thought. I wanted to get over there as soon as 
possible, so I stood up, and began to change clothes.  I threw my 
sweat shirt to the floor as I started walking over to the closet.  I felt 
my underwear riding up the crack of my butt, so I reached my hand 
down the back of my sweatpants to straighten things out.  But 
instead of thick cotton, my hand grasped something else.  I ripped 
my sweats off and looked down.  I was wearing panties!  Pink silk 
panties!  "Holy shit! . . . "  I started to hyperventilate.  I ran over to 
the dresser on opened the drawer where I kept my underwear.  I 
almost fell to the floor.  Instead of Jockey shorts and boxers I saw 
a drawer full of women's underwear!  "Oh no!  Not this!  This 
can't be happening!" I screamed.  I ran to the mirror and pulled off 
my tee shirt.  As I looked at myself closely, I could see that indeed 
my suspected fears appeared to be coming true.  Something went 
wrong on my mission . . . something went terribly wrong . . . and it 
appears that it somehow has affected my past!  I ran to my wallet 
and pulled out my drivers license.  Staring at it for a moment and 
then reading it aloud . . . "Ms. Stephanie Starr.  Stephanie?!  Oh 
my God!"  I dropped it to the floor and began to cry . . .

"OK . . . OK, I've got to pull myself together."  I thought.  "Think 
man, think!"  Somehow I needed to figure out what had happened 
and most importantly, what to do about it.  I again picked up my 
drivers license and began to stare at it.  "Wait a minute.  My 
birthday . . . it's changed too.  I was born on April 27, not April 
29!  What the hell could have happened!?  I don't get it.  Somehow 
I must have done something to change my own birthday . . . and in 
turn . . . change my sex as well!  But what . . . what the hell could I 
have done?  Think man . . . OK . . . I jumped back to the evening 
of July 23, 2054.  Lets see . . . today's date is May 9, 2079.  I was 
born on April 27, 2055.  That was 24 years and a month ago . . . 
and the date I jumped to was some 8 or 9 months before that.  Wait 
a minute!  Holy shit!  9 months!  Oh my god . . . the date that I 
jumped to . . . somehow how I must have changed something.  
Something that affected my own conception!  Oh my god!  What 
have I done . . . what have I done!"

Again I buried my head in my hands and began to cry.  After a few 
minutes, I staggered into the bathroom to take another look at what 
was happening to me.  The first thing that struck me was my lack 
of body hair.  In fact, as I rubbed my hand over my chest, the 
remaining hair seemed to fall out before my eyes!  My nipples 
seemed tender as well. "Oh my god . . . I'm probably going to start 
growing tits!" I gasped aloud.  I then noticed that I was shorter . . . 
most definitely 5 or 6 inches.  It was also pretty obvious that I had 
lost 20 or 30 pounds as well.  My skin seemed a bit softer . . . 
maybe finer.  And my nails . . . my god damn nails just kept 
fucking growing.  They must have been nearly an inch by now.  I 
grabbed my nail clippers and went to work again.  Maybe 
subconsciously I was trying to stave off what was inevitably 
happening to me.  I threw them on the counter top and put my 
hands to my face in disbelief.  

"Come on now.  Think!  There's got to be something that you can 
do . . . just think!"  And then it came to me.  "Maybe  its not to late 
. . . maybe it'll still work!"  I had to get to the base before it was 
too late.  I had to try to sneak into the base and do an unauthorized 
jump.  "If I could just jump back just a couple of days . . . I could 
warn myself . . . tell myself not to try it.  Then none of this would 
have ever happened, and when I jump back to my own time, 
everything should be back to the way it was.  I'll lose my 
inheritance for sure that way, but shit . . . that's a small price to 
pay to get my life back again."  I ran over to the closet and pulled 
out my uniform.  "I've got to get there fast.  Before I change too 
much.  Hopefully I can get past the checkpoint, the rest should be 
fairly easy."  Hurriedly, I put on my uniform.  My body had 
already changed enough that I had a hard time keeping my pants 
up.  I had to roll my sleeves up as well.  After all was said and 
done . . . I still thought I could pass as myself, as long as I hurried.  
I grabbed my wallet and headed out the door.  As the elevator 
doors opened, I was confronted by Jim Wright . . . an acquaintance 
of mine from upstairs.
He greeted me.  "Hi Stephan, how's it going?"
"Fine Jim, and you?" I said.  ("Thank god . . . he called me 
Stephan!" I thought to myself.)
"Don't you ever get the weekend off?" he asked.
"Well sometimes I do.  But today I just need to put in some extra 
time . . . Uncle Sam can be pretty demanding you know."  I said 
while forcing a fake smile.  Finally the door opened on the first 
floor.
"Well I'll catch you around Jim".
"OK . . . take it easy" he said.
I waved politely and headed out to my car.  When I got in, the first 
thing that I noticed was that I couldn't reach the petals.  "I'm 
fucking shrinking!" I quipped in a panicked tone.
"Got to hurry . . . got to hurry before it's too late!"

The drive seemed to take forever.  I'm not sure, but I felt like I had 
done some more transforming over the past half-hour or so.  I was 
afraid to look at myself . . . so I turned the rear view mirror away 
from me out of fear for what I might see.  As I approached the base 
I pulled over to the curb for a moment to pause.  I strained to see 
who was on duty at the checkpoint tonight.  "Good . . . it looks like 
Private Murphy.  He's usually a little more lax than Johnson.  I've 
got to pull this off somehow.  Thank god it's dark outside."  I 
dimmed the dashboard lights a bit and put on my hat.  I swallowed 
hard and pulled up to the gate.  It was obvious that Murphy 
recognized my car.  He opened up the door and stepped outside.
"Evening sir." He said.
Trying to look causal, I rested my face in the palm of my left hand.  
With my right hand I held out my ID badge.
"That's OK sir . . . I think I've seen it a few times before." He said 
chuckling.  He turned and waved to his partner, who in turn, raised 
the gate.
"Have a good night sir." Johnson said as he saluted.
I gave a quick nod and took off through the gate.
"Thank God! I di . . ." my voice cracked as I tried to speak aloud.
"My voice . . . what's happened to my voice?!"  I said in horror 
while clutching my throat.  "I've got to hurry . . . or it'll be to 
late."

I pulled up to the secured parking area and slid my access card into 
the card reader.  "Hopefully there shouldn't be anyone around this 
time of  night." I thought.  I parked the car, got out and headed to 
the door.  I almost tripped over my pant legs.  So I quickly bent 
over and rolled them up.  I was shocked that I had to roll them up 
at least 8 inches or so.  When I stood back up I took note that all of 
my clothes were equally as baggy.  One inside the main door I 
made a quick right turn toward the officers entrance.  I was about 
20 feet away from the night watchman at the front desk who raised 
his head from his newspaper momentarily.  I heard his voice from 
behind me.
"Evening sir."
I raised my hand and gave an abrupt wave of acknowledgment 
without turning around.  I fumbled nervously with my access card 
and slid it into the slot.  A computer voice shot back . . .
"Card verification accepted.  Please place hand on scanner for 
fingerprint identification."
I thought to myself "This had better work!"
The pale blue light made two sweeps over my palm, not unlike a 
photocopy machine.  I was relieved to hear . . .
"Fingerprint identification positive.  Good evening Lieutenant 
Staar."
With that the airlock before me depressurized, released, and swung 
open.  I quickly walk through, and when on the other side, wiped 
the sweat from my brow with my forearm.  Inadvertently, I 
knocked my hat off my head.  As I reached down to pick it up, hair 
fell in front of my eyes!  "Jesus Christ!" I quipped as reached up to 
feel my lengthening mane.  I picked up my hat and quickly started 
running down the hall to the elevator.  That's when I noticed it . . . 
the bouncing of my chest.  My heat skipped a beat as I stopped in 
silent horror.  I moved my jacket aside and gripped my chest with 
both hands.  The hair stood up on the back of my neck as I firmly 
squeezed two small breasts under my shirt.  "Time's running out!  
I've got to hurry!  Please God, let me make it!"  I continued 
running to the elevator and pressed the down button, almost 
breaking one of my half inch fingernails!  Once inside, I pressed 
level B8, and began my decent eight floor underground.

After making my way through several more security points, I 
finally reached my destination . . . the time lab.  I inserted my 
security card into the scanner.
"Card verification accepted."  The computer said.  "Please enter 12 
digit security access number."
I typed it in as quickly as I could.
"Security access number verification accepted.  Please place eye in 
front of optical scanner for retinal identification."
The bright blue light flashed across my left eye.
The computer answered "Retinal verification not accepted. Please 
place eye in front of optical scanner for second attempt of retinal 
identification.  Security alert status activated.  You have 15 
seconds before security is alerted.   15 . . . 14 . . . 13 . . . "
"Oh shit!  It's too late!" I said in a panic.  I placed my other eye in 
front of the scanner and pressed the start button.  Once again the 
bright blue light tracked across my face until it pierced deep within 
my eye.  I said a silent prayer as the countdown continued.
"7 . . . 6 . . . 5 . . . Retinal verification accepted.  Security alert 
canceled. Good evening Lieutenant Staar."  I closed my eyes and 
said my thanks as the heavy steel door swung open.

I quickly ran over to the storage room and claimed my `silver suit'.  
I undressed nervously.  Intentionally trying not to look at my body . 
. . I couldn't afford any more distractions right now.  The fact that 
one of my eyes didn't scan properly had me freaked out.  Our 
`silver suits' were genetically encoded with our DNA as a security 
measure.  If the `suit' didn't get a positive DNA match from me . . 
. I was finished.  The jump would be aborted and security would be 
all over the place in a matter of seconds.  The `suit' was extremely 
large on me.  I zipped it up and started setting the target date and 
location on the remote command unit.  I set it for my apartment, 3 
days ago . . . May 6, 2079 - 8 AM.  I knew that my old self was 
off reading the Will at the lawyers then.  That way I knew I could 
materialize undetected and still have plenty of time to track my old 
self down and stop him from making the jump back to my parents 
house.  Then since the interference with the past will have never 
taken place . . . I should transform back into my normal self and be 
able to use the `silver suit' to leap back to my own time and 
continue my life as if nothing had ever happened.
"There . . . all programmed." I said.
I quickly ran around the room activating all of the necessary 
systems.  I bypassed most safety checklists to save time.  With all 
of these systems turned on . . . someone was bound to wonder what 
the hell was going on down here.  I probably had two minutes 
before security would be down here as a precaution.  I quickly ran 
over to the targeting grid and stood there as a number of lasers 
began to scan my body.  I locked on my helmet and stood 
motionless in a cloud of dry ice. Flashing lights filled the room.  
The computer generated voice started to countdown.
"De-materialization in T-minus 10 seconds.  Mark.  10 . . . 9 . . . 8 
. . . 7 . . . 6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . 0 . . . initiate de-
materialization."
I pressed the glowing green button on my wrist, and once more , 
the familiar warping of the world around me began to take place.  
As I began to de-materialize, I felt a sense of relief.  I had made it 
this far.  The hard part was over.  Now all I had to do was to find 
myself in the past and do some fancy talking . . . or so I thought.  A 
few moments later, I could see the walls of my bedroom beginning 
to come into focus.  I was almost there.  But as things started to 
become more and more solid around me, I started to feel strange.  
Before I had completely materialized, I became dizzy and blacked 
out .

I awoke face down on the floor.  At first I had no recollection of 
where I was . . . until I noticed that I was wearing my helmet.  
Then it all started to come back. Still sitting on the floor, I propped 
myself up against my bed to clear my head for a few moments.  I 
released the airlock on my helmet and pulled it off to get some 
fresh air.  As I did, waves of long golden hair fell all around me.  I 
grabbed it and pulled it in front of my face to stare at it.  If I had 
any moment of peace to forget about my predicament, it was surely 
over now.  "Wait a minute." I said slowly.  "My hair wasn't nearly 
this long just a few minutes ago.  What the hell's going on?  How 
long was I blacked out?"  I quickly looked down at the remote 
command unit on my wrist to check the status of my arrival and the 
current time.  "Oh my God!"  I gasped.  "Something went wrong.  I 
didn't materialize at 8:00 AM on May 6 . . . I materialized at 8:00 
AM on May 8!  It's currently 2:47 PM . . . so I must have been out 
on the floor for over six hours!"  I tried to calm myself down.  I 
still had over six hours to find myself and put an end to all of this.  
I thought hard about what I was doing in the past on this specific 
day.  "Let's see . . . I was out all day running around.  Shit!  I'll 
never be able to find myself.  The only place that I'll have any 
chance is to head myself off is at the base.  The only problem is 
that I can't remember what time I got there.  I think it was some 
time between 8:30 and 9:00 PM, but I can't be sure.  That's OK.  I 
can do this.  It's going to work."  I said over and over as I tried to 
reassure my self.  "First things first.  I've got to get myself cleaned 
up a bit."

I stood up, placed my helmet on the bed, and headed into the 
bathroom.  As I did, hair again fell in my face reminding me that 
over the past six hours, my body transformation hadn't done much 
slowing down.  My heart pounded heavily as I turned on the light 
in the bathroom.  I didn't want to look at my face first . . . I was 
afraid.  So I decided to take off the `suit' first.  The `suit' was so 
big on me that the contour of my body was completely hidden 
behind it.  First I pulled off my gloves.  It seemed so strange. The 
hands I looked at were no longer mine.  They were so thin and 
delicate . . . and with nails at least an inch long.  I started to 
hyperventilate as I reach up to unzip the front of my suit.  I decided 
to do it quickly. Somehow I thought that it might be easier on me.  
So with my eyes closed,  I unzipped it down to my waist and 
allowed the loose fabric to fall off my shoulders and arms to leave 
my entire upper torso bare.  "OK Stephan . . . take a deep breath . . 
. everything's going to be all right."  I open my eyes and reeled 
back against the wall in a combination of shock and horror.  "Jesus 
. . . Nooooo!"  I shrieked in a high pitched voice.  "I've got tits!"  I 
reached up and grabbed them.  They seemed absolutely huge to me.  
My tiny hands couldn't even fit around them.  I cupped them, 
allowing their full weight to rest their momentarily.  I instinctively 
raised my head to look at my reflection in the mirror.  "Oh my 
God!"  My voice trembled.  I had completely changed.  As I looked 
hard at the face in the mirror, I could still see myself.  It's just that 
my old self was softened.  My features slightly changed . . . now so 
feminine and delicate.  Behind the full lips, high cheek bones, 
dainty nose, and flowing blonde hair . . . it was still me.  I again 
gazed down at my naked torso.  My breasts stuck out from my 
thin, almost bony, body like two balloons.  I touched them lightly 
with my fingers.  Then instinctively, I started kneading them in 
disbelief.  They were so solid and firm.  The nipples seemed so big, 
so hard.  My eyes traveled downward looking over my impossibly 
thin waist and smooth stomach.  The sight of my `silver suit' 
hanging precariously over my broad hips sent another chill through 
my body.  "Oh my God."  I gasped as I realized what might be 
there (or not be there) when I took off the rest of my suit.  I knew 
one thing.  I should have had one hell of a hard on about now . . . 
but I felt nothing.  I tried to concentrate . . . to see if I could feel 
my cock.  But still nothing.  I slowly unzipped the rest of my `suit' 
and let it drop to the floor.  I was simply speechless.  My cock was 
gone!  Nothing left but some sparse blond pubic hair.  I spread my 
legs apart a bit and noticed a familiar looking geometry.  It was 
just that I wasn't used to seeing it on myself!  I slowly moved my 
hand down my flat stomach and in between my legs.  My fingers 
slid into a damp slit.  I quickly pulled it back as if I had just 
touched a hot stovetop.  I looked at my wet hand before me.  I 
raised it to my face and inhaled.  The smell that greeted me was 
again familiar.  I slowly reached my hand back down to my new 
vagina and started to explore some more.  Before I knew it I was 
panting in excitement.  The feelings were so new . . . so different.  I 
slid to the floor and began to masturbate.  With one hand rubbing 
my tits and the other my clitoris, it wasn't long before I was 
shuttering with pleasure.  As my orgasm subsided, I shook . . . and 
then began to cry.  "Please God . . . please.   Just let me get my old 
body back." I prayed.  "I don't want to be a woman . . . I just want 
to be myself again."  After a few minutes, I got up and showered.  
As I did, I continued to pray. . . hoping that somehow, God would 
have mercy on me.

While drying myself off, I tried to make sense of everything.  "How 
could I have materialized on the wrong date?" I wondered.  
"Perhaps my genetic imprint was off by enough that it caused some 
type of  malfunction.  Well, at least I got here . . . that's all that 
really matters."  I was distracted by my own reflection in the 
mirror.  It seemed so strange to see someone else's reflection there . 
. . moving just as I did.  It made it seem even stranger that it was a 
reflection of the other sex.  I again became transfixed by the sight 
of breasts protruding from my chest.  I once more held them in 
wonderment.  "Well Stephan.  It seems like we've got a bit of a 
problem here.  I don't think any of my clothes are going to fit this 
body of mine here."  One thing was for sure.  I definitely knew that 
if I didn't make myself look presentable, my old self wouldn't take 
my new self seriously enough to even give me the time of day.  I 
had to find something to wear besides my old male clothes.  I went 
to my dresser drawer and pulled out an envelope where I usually 
kept some extra cash.  I found slightly over two hundred bucks. 
"Shit! That's not enough . . . and I have absolutely no access to 
any other money while I look like this."  Then it dawned on me.  
"Lisa's stuff!  I wonder if I can use that?!"  My sometimes 
girlfriend had gone out to dinner with me for my birthday a few 
weeks ago.  She had inadvertently forgotten her clothing and 
overnight bag when she left in the morning.  I ran to the closet and 
grabbed her things.  

"Hmmm . . . if this dress fits . . ."  It was a black and white floral 
party dress that came to about mid-thigh.  "A little formal, but it'll 
work." I thought.  I laid it on the bed and opened her overnight bag.  
I gulped hard at the sight of her lingerie inside.  "I never thought 
I'd see the day that I'd ever be putting this stuff on."  I said aloud.  
I picked up a pair of white silk & lace thong panties.  "Oh great . . 
. its figures she had to wear a thong that night."  I thought in 
exasperation.  It seemed so small . . . like it wouldn't cover 
anything.  But I guess I didn't have much that needed to be covered 
right now anyway.  I found the front and stepped into it.  It felt so 
strange to feel the fabric moving up my smooth legs.  I squatted 
slightly with my legs apart and pulled them up over my hips.  I felt 
it expand tightly over my new form.  I turned to look at my rear in 
the mirror.  All that was visible was a small triangle of cloth above 
my cheeks.  From their, the tiny thong disappeared between my full 
ass to reaper again in the shape of another tiny triangle barely 
covering my smooth crotch in the front.  In fact, my sparse golden 
pubic hair was visible through the lace floral pattern.  The sides 
arched high above my protruding hips.  "Oh my G-o-d . . . "  I 
gasped.  It was a sight I'd seen many times before.  In fact.  It 
looked exactly like the sight I'd seen just a few weeks before . . . on 
Lisa!  It was no different than any other woman's pussy I'd ever 
seen . . . smooth and flat  The only problem was that it was now on 
me!

Again I reached into the bag.  This time pulling out her lacy 
matching bra.  I looked at the size.  It was a 36 C.  Fortunately, it 
hooked in the front . . . so I slipped my arms through the straps and 
pulled it up over my shoulders.  I pulled the fabric down and over 
my bare breasts.  I struggled to get it hooked, but I finally did.  It 
was way too tight.  "Fuck.  That's just great I thought."  I tried to 
loosen the straps and try again, but it was no use . . . it just wasn't 
going to fit.  I discarded it on the bed and hoped that I could wear 
the dress braless.  I next unraveled some black stockings.  I curled 
them up and placed my foot inside.  I pulled them up my legs to 
their stopping point . . . just below my crotch.  The cool tight panty 
hose felt so different, so strange to me.  I next unbuttoned the dress 
and slid it on.  At least it seemed to be my size.  As I buttoned up 
the front,  the waist contracted to fit snugly to my thin waist.  My 
wide hips and rounded ass filled the fairly tight fitting skirt with a 
curvaceous silhouette.  Fortunately, I was able to button the front 
over my large breasts.  They filled the top of my dress with a shape 
that would cause any man to stare lustfully.  My slightly pointed 
and up turned nipples made a ghostly imprint in the fabric alluding 
to what was contained behind it.  I turned to look at myself in the 
mirror.  It was almost unfathomable what I saw.  As I looked my 
self over, it became apparent that my hair was going to be a 
problem.  I had absolutely no experience in styling hair like this.  
Then I had an idea,  I had plenty of time . . . so I thought I'd let a 
professional handle this mess.  I took a brush to it, found an old 
rubber band, and pulled it into a pony tail.  "At least that will hold 
it for a while." I thought.  I went to the closet and slipped on Lisa's 
black low heels.  They pinched my toes tightly.  "Great, they're to 
small too . . ." I said in exasperation.  "I guess I have to buy some 
new shoes as well, but for now, these will have to do."  I grabbed 
my money, threw it in Lisa's purse, and was on my way.

As I exited my apartment building, I was acutely aware of the 
looks that I was getting from people.  Its just that as a man, I 
wasn't used to being checked out by everyone passing by.  "This is 
so humiliating" I thought. I sure didn't help matters that my braless 
tits bounced seductively with each and every step that I took.  All I 
wanted to do was to grab them with both hands and restrain them . 
. . but I quickly came to my senses.  I raised my hand and quickly 
hailed a cab.  Once inside I told the driver to take me to the Metro 
Mall on the outskirts of town.

When I arrived . . . all I wanted to do was to get this hair fixed and 
get the hell out of here.  I couldn't stand all of the stares I was 
getting.  Seeing things from the other side, all I could think was . . . 
"My God men are so obvious when they stare!"  It actually made 
me sick to my stomach to think that other men were checking me 
out.  What was also strange was that women were checking me out 
too.  "How can women take living like this?" I wondered.  All of 
the looks made me feel self conscious, almost as if somehow people 
could really see that I was still a man.  I nervously turned and 
gazed at myself in a storefront window.  The sight of my jiggling 
breasts greeted me to remind me that nobody was going to peg me 
for a man!  Finally, I made it to a Women's shoe store.  "9 West . . 
. that looks like it will do just fine."

I was greeted by a young lady about my age.
"Good afternoon Ms.  Is there something that I can help you find 
today?"
"Well . . . actually yes.  I'd like to find another pair of shoes 
similar to what I'm wearing.  These have gotten a little small for 
me." I said.
She guided me over to a display and showed me several similar 
styles.
"Do you have a preference for any?" She asked.
"No not really." I said  "Why don't you just pick out a couple and 
I'll try them on to see which ones I like."
"All right.  Give me a minute, I'll be right back.  What size do you 
wear?" She asked.
"That's a good question." I responded.  I kicked off my right shoe 
and looked at the size.  "These are size 8 . . . so I guess maybe an 8 
r or 9?"
"Sure . . . I'll bring both.  Be right back."  She turned and went to 
the stock room.
I sat down on the bench and kicked off my other shoe.  "God that 
feels good." I thought.  I leaned back and relaxed.  "Those fucking 
things were killing me."  In a few moments, she returned carrying 
several boxes.
"Here we are."  She said.
I slid to the front of the bench and started to bend down to try on a 
pair.
"Here.  Let me get those for you." She insisted.  She knelt down on 
the floor in front of me and opened a box.  As she leaned forward 
to slip the shoe on my foot.  I noticed that she glanced upward for a 
moment.   What awaited her was a full view of my crotch between 
my open legs.
"Oh my God!" I thought. "I'm sitting like a fucking guy!"  My legs 
were spread apart at a fairly large angle . . . exposing everything 
that I had, or didn't have, to the world!  I clinched my thighs 
together in reflex.
"Oh my God . . . I'm so embarrassed."  I said to the girl as my face 
turned bright red.
"That's OK . . . really.  Every once in a while I forget that I'm 
wearing a dress too.  Besides, no harm done.  I didn't see anything 
that I haven't seen before." She said nonchalantly.
"I know . . . but still . . . I'm soooo embarrassed.  Please forgive 
me." I said.
"Oh stop.  Don't worry about it.  Honest."  She said while giving 
me an innocent smile.
After my blushing had faded, I settled on a pair of shoes.  I paid for 
them and decided to wear them out.
"Thank you ma'am.  Please come back again." She said as she 
handed me my receipt.
"Thank you.  Bye now."  I said as I walked out of the store.  I 
made my way to the mall directory and found a Hair Saloon with 
some fancy French name.  I didn't need to be picky, so I didn't 
look for anything else.  A short walk and an escalator ride later, 
and I was there.

I walked inside the fancy salon and immediately felt out of place.  
At first I wanted to just turn around and run away from this, but I 
came to my senses and decided to stick it out.  An obviously 
feminine man behind the counter greeted me.
"Hello ms.  Is there something I can do to help you?" He asked.
I explained that I had a date tonight and was interested in making 
myself look presentable.  He looked at the appointment book, 
smiled and informed me that someone would be freed up shortly 
and that they would be able to take care of things for me.  After 
about a half hour wait I was starting to get nervous about the time 
when a beautiful young brunette came to fetch me.  After 
explaining my situation and my tight time schedule again, she 
suggested that they could also do my makeup and give me a 
manicure and still get me out of here by 7:00 PM or so.  That still 
gave me an hour and a half to get over to the base.  That wouldn't 
be a problem, so I agreed.  I tried to keep assuring myself that this 
was all necessary and that it would all be over soon.  "Just hang in 
there." I told myself.

The time flew by quickly.  And when all of the different women 
were done, I was stunned at my appearance.  I was simply 
beautiful.  My hair, my face . . . I was a total knockout by both 
male and female standards.  I got up, straightened out my dress and 
gazed at the total package.
"Well . . . what do you think?"  the young lady said.
"Amazing . . . simply amazing . . . "  I said slowly while staring in 
disbelief.
"Well.   That's a pretty unique compliment!"  she laughed.  "But 
I'll take it!"
I finally broke my gaze and walked up front to pay.  "Damn.  That 
was expensive!"  I thought as I forked over almost 120 bucks.  I 
thanked the young woman, gave her a tip, and hurried on my way.  
After my makeover, I was even more self conscious about how I 
looked and felt.  Again . . . I kept telling myself that this was the 
only way that I'd ever get a chance to talk with my old self.  If I 
looked like some kind of a loser, there was no chance that I'd ever 
come off as convincing.  "Not too much longer . . . just another few 
hours like this and everything should be back to normal."

Once outside, I hailed another taxi.
"Good evening lady."  The driver said.
"Hi."  I responded.  "I need to get to the military base out near 
Route 16 . . . it's just before you get to Port Jensen.  Have you 
been there before?"  I asked.
"Never dropped anyone off their before, but I know where it is."  
He responded.
"Good . . . I'm in a pretty big hurry.  If you get me their fast, 
there's an extra 50 bucks in it for you.  OK?"
"Sure Lady.  I'll do my best." He said.  And with that, we were off.

Along the way, he was trying to make some idle chit chat . . . but I 
was hardly in the mood.  I just kept going over and over in my 
mind what I was going to say.  All I knew was that I couldn't 
frighten him off.  I remained deep in thought until I was snapped 
out of it by a loud noise.
B-A-N-G !
"What was that?!" I yelled.
"I think we just had a tire blowout."  He said shortly as he pulled 
over to the side of the road.
"How long is this going to take to fix?" I said hysterically.  "I've 
got to be there in 20 minutes!"
"I'm sorry lady.  There's nothing I can do.  I've got to change it . . 
. then I'll get you there as soon as possible."
"We're not going to make it."  I said under my breath.  I was 
panicked.  I got out of the car.
"Hey lady?  What are you doing?" the man yelled over the sound 
of passing traffic.
"Hitchhiking." I yelled back.  He tried to talk me out of it, but I 
hardly heard a word he said.  After 10 minutes or so, a woman in 
about her mid-forties pulled over and asked if there was a problem.  
I told her that we had just had a flat and that I was panicked to 
make my appointment at the base.  Perhaps it was because I 
sounded sincere . . . or perhaps because I looked like a woman, the 
lady offered me a ride.  Before I jumped in I asked the driver to 
meet me there anyway.  I paid him and told him that I'd give him 
his 50 bucks when he showed to pick me up.  He nodded and I 
quickly turned and jumped into the woman's car.  She tried to 
hurry, but she just wasn't a very aggressive driver.  We finally got 
there.  I thanked her and stepped out of the car near a bench that 
was some 20 feet from the main entry checkpoint. She asked if I'd 
be all right.  I told her I'd be fine and thanked her again.  As she 
pulled away, I looked down at my watch.  It was 8:37 PM.  My 
heart was pounding.  I decided to wait a few more minutes to see if 
my former self pulled up to the entrance at the checkpoint. There I 
would intercept him and ask if we could talk.  Knowing myself, I 
knew that I would say yes to such an attractive woman.  From 
there, I just had to sell myself and my story.

I paced back and forth . . . nothing.  It was 8:47.  Minutes seemed 
like hours.  I was nervous and scared.  "What if I missed him?  
What if I was too late and he's already inside?!"  I decided that I 
had to do something.  I started walking over to the checkpoint.  
Private Thompson saw me approach and stepped outside.
"I'm sorry ma'am, but this is a restricted area."
"I understand that." I said.  "I'm here to see Lieutenant Starr.  Has 
he arrived yet?"
"Maybe." Private Johnson said.
"Maybe?  What does that mean?" I asked shortly.
"What is your relation with the lieutenant ma'am?  Was he 
expecting you?"  He said.
"Look . . . I've never really met him.  It's just extremely important 
that I talk with him.  Please call him and ask him to come out to the 
gate."  I pleaded.  "Look.  I've got to talk to him.  Just let me speak 
with him on the phone.  Please . . . please . . . I'll do ANYTHING . 
. . please just help me."  I was begging.
"All right ma'am.  Come inside.  Let's see what we can do." He 
responded.
I was too upset and then relieved to have noticed how he was 
looking at me . . . checking me out.  Little did I realize that I had 
just uttered some words that had spelled my own doom.

As I walked inside the checkpoint, Private Smith stood up and 
checked me out as well.  
Private Johnson spoke out addressing the other guard.  "Our little 
friend here wants to talk with Lieutenant Starr.  She said she'd do 
anything if I helped her out.  What do you think about that Tom?"
"Any thing?  Well it must be pretty important then hunh?" he said 
while smirking.
It was then that I realized what the two men we're driving at.  
Perhaps it was because I was so dressed up . . . perhaps because I 
was alone . . . but somehow the must have mistaken me for a 
prostitute.
"Wait a minute guys!" I yelled.  "What he hell are you two 
thinking of here?!"
"Just a little `trick' before we call your boyfriend honey . . ."  
Private Johnson said.  It can be pretty lonely sitting out here all 
night, just Tom and me."  A disgusting smirk came to his face.
"There's no way guys!  Just no fucking way!  I'm not a prostitute . 
. . I'm just here to see Lieutenant Starr."  I said angrily.
"Suit yourself ma'am" he said.  "Now why don't you just run 
along before I call the MP's . . . OK?
His words caused my mind to spin.  What was I to do?  I'd had to 
have them call him.  There was no choice.  Otherwise, I'd be stuck 
in this chicks body for the rest of my life.  I swallowed hard and 
was sickened by the words that were about to come from my 
mouth.
"OK"  I said softly while looking down at the floor.
"What did you say young lady? He asked.
"I said OK.  I'll do it.  But you've got to swear that you'll call 
Lieutenant Starr when we're done.  Got a deal?"
A smile came across both of there faces.  "You got it babe." 
Private Johnson said.

The next thing I knew was that I was being fondled.  I recoiled 
back out of instinct.
"What's the matter babe?  A little shy?" he laughed.
I grit my teeth and allowed them to continue.  Within a minute, I 
was on the floor with one of them licking my pussy through my 
panties.  The other pulled open my dress, exposing my large tits.
"Nice . . . very nice." I heard him say.  He fondled them and then 
bent over to suck them.  Even though this whole scene was making 
me sick.  It was impossible to ignore the sensations flowing 
throughout my body.  I was disgusted, but yet turned on.  Without 
even noticing it, my thong was ripped off.  The next thing I felt was 
a cool tongue licking my hot wet vagina.  I purred and shuttered in 
reflex.  I closed my eyes enjoying the new sensations.  My moans 
of pleasure lasted for only a few seconds as I sensed something 
near my face.  I opened my eyes and gasped just in time to see 
Private Smith squatting over my face and lowering his cock down 
into my mouth.  Before I could do anything to stop him, he had my 
arms pinned on the floor behind my head.  He drove his cock deep 
into my throat.  I tried to tell him to stop, but the muffled sound of 
my voice was indistinguishable.  It was so big . . . I felt like I was 
going to choke. In a few moments, my moans of protest turned into 
groans of pleasure.  Concurrently, my pussy felt like it was going 
to explode from the oral sex that Private Johnson was giving me. 
He rolled me over and spread my legs apart.  I knew what was 
coming next but was unprepared for the sensation.  I shrieked in 
delight as his throbbing cock filled the new void between my legs.  
Knelling, he started pumping me back and forth.  Again my 
pleasure was interrupted by a huge cock stuffed back into my 
mouth.  But this time, there was no disgust . . . my body had taken 
over.  I actually WANTED it in my mouth.  I sucked it as hard and 
fast as I could.  My long golden hair covering my face as I bobbed 
my head vigorously back and forth.  My large tits swung freely 
from my opened dress slapping together with every thrust.  Within 
a minute or two I felt Johnson tense up.  Before I could orgasm, I 
felt the warm rush of semen spurting deep within my pussy.  Just 
then, he jerked away suddenly.  "A car.  Someone's coming!  
Quick, you two stay low . . . below the countertop.  I'll take care of 
this."
With that, Smith pulled his dick out of my mouth just as I felt my 
own orgasm starting to build.  We both ducked down below the 
countertop as Johnson jumped up on the stool so as to be visible 
from the outside.  While on the floor, Smith started fingering my 
aching pussy.  I uncontrollably straddled his face and lowered my 
dripping crotch down to his mouth.  As he ate it, I found his cock 
right in front of my face.  Without thought, I plunged my head 
down over his shaft and started blow him like a slut.  My orgasm 
was building again.  Soon my entire body was on fire.  It hit me 
like a ton of bricks.  A encompassing wave unlike anything I'd ever 
felt before swept through my body.  In the background, I could 
hear Private Johnson talking to the vehicle outside.  For whatever 
reason, some of his words snapped me out my state of ecstasy . . . 
kind of a de-ja-vu experience.  Somewhere, I had heard them 
before. Private Johnson was yelling out the window . . .
"Not tonight sir if you don't mind . . . I twisted my knee this 
afternoon and I'm having a hard time getting around right now".

Chills raced up and down my spine as my mind tried to place the 
familiar words.  Suddenly, I felt Smith's cock tense up in my 
mouth.  Before I could react to either situation, hot liquid was 
spurting into my mouth.  I gagged as he held my head firmly in 
place.  I had no choice but to swallow as much as I could . . . the 
rest oozed out my mouth around his cock.  Then, as I tried to pry 
myself away from him, everything snapped into focus.  My body 
froze as my mind raced to decipher it all.  I REMEMBERED 
where I had heard those words before.  I heard them on THIS very 
same night a couple of days ago.  Only I had heard them from the 
car that had just pulled away outside!  Now I knew why neither 
Private Johnson nor Private Smith came out to my car that night . . 
. it was because my future self was to busy fucking them!  I'd lost 
my chance.  These guys never had any intention of calling him 
before . . . and they certainly weren't going to call him now.  I was 
just some cheap slut that they had used to their advantage.  I had 
nobody to blame but myself.  I was the one who was late, and I 
was the one who panicked because of it.  It was my choice to come 
in here . . . my choice to have sex with them . . . and my own fault 
that I blew my only chance to warn myself of my  impending doom.

It was then, as I sat there dazed with my pussy exposed and cum 
dripping out of my mouth, that I realized that I had actually made a 
very important discovery.  Time could actually never be changed.  
It was all interconnected . . . it was just one big loop that played 
over and over again.  It was actually impossible to CHANGE time.  
We were all just along for the ride.  I looked down and cupped my 
huge tits in my tiny hands.  I began to cry as I realized that this 
was my fate.  I was trapped . . . displaced from my own time in a 
body that should never have been mine in the first place.  Done in 
by my own selfish actions . . . I had paid a dear price.  For the rest 
of my life, I'd be trapped in the body of a woman.
 
The End
