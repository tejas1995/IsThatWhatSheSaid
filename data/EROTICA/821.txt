                               **Chapter 1**
     "I knew  it," Jeffrey  muttered to  himself.   "One letter  in my
INBOX, and  it had  to be  this one."   In the past three years of his
dealings with the government, they had always used private couriers to
correspond, or  more often  the telephone.   But when the message came
via  MCI  MAIL,  he  knew  that  his  three-year  project  was  at  an
unsuccessful end.
  
          From: George F. Frankel    MCI ID: 213-9164
          To:  * Jeffrey Landers     MCI ID: 150-1060
          Message-ID:  5M113684/818802K3
          Subj: Final Project Decision - Confidential
  
          Dear Mr. Landers,
  
          It is  with great  regret that  we must inform you
          that your  proposal to  refine, and  implement the
          use of,  the device  we have  discusssed has  been
          denied.   Unfortunately with  budget cuts applied,
          this department  does not  have the  resources  to
          properly   administer   programs   which   consist
          primarily of  research and  development.   I  will
          personally keep  the proper information on file so
          that, if  the situtation changes, we might be able
          to continue  work on what could be a valuable tool
          to our  society.   I also  commend your  work  and
          thank you  for your efforts to this point.  Formal
          notification will  be sent  to IDT  shortly  along
          with cost recovery information.
  
          Sincerely Yours,
  
          Gen. G. F. Frankel
          Human Services
  
  
     He switched  the terminal  off.   Government Imbeciles.  Not only
did they make any sort of effective demonstration impossible, but they
had to break the news through MCI MAIL.
     Strangely, he  felt little  anger.  He had a good time working on
the project,  excellent pay,  at the  mere expense of his social life.
His time  had been  devoted to  endless revisions,  modifications, and
testing of  the Device.   It  wasn't his fault that the Federal people
who came  to  test  it  were  just  too--  too--  boring  to  use  it.
Unfortunately he'd never be able to prove that.  He wasn't sure of the
situations that caused the tests to fail.  It worked for him, he felt,
because he had a good imagination.  Good enough to think up the device
in the first place means that one must be good enough to use it.
     The Device  was a  thought amplifier.   Bred  from some  licensed
Japanese electro-encephalographic  technologies that never saw any use
outside some  experimental psychiatric  clinics that (giggle) were now
being sued  for some  sort of  fraud, the  Device was  a miracle  more
stunning than  the space program, the new light-speed superprocessors,
or Ronco's solid-state IR laser turkey carving set.  It started out as
a device  which could clarify thought patterns for analysis by trained
therapists, for  use in  mental hospitals.  The Feds got involved when
the NSA  wanted to  know if  it could  be used to read minds.  Even if
Jeffrey could  have spent a few years researching that application, he
wouldn't think  of it--  because certainly  he wouldn't  be ALLOWED to
think of  it if  the device became a reality.  But Jeffrey's employer,
Interactive  Device   Technologies,  liked   the  idea   of  lucrative
government  contracts   and  encouraged   him  to  continue  with  the
development.   Three years  later, Jeffrey  and IDT  had finished  the
thought amplifier,  but this  last MCI  letter meant  that  there  was
NOBODY, and  that meant nobody, interested in continuing with it.  Now
that IDT  had no  hopes of  a  $12  billion  contract,  Jeffrey  would
probably be out of job.
  
  
                            *** Chapter 2  ***
     Cheryl walked  into the  Lab.   "Is that the TA-12?" she queried,
pointing to  the metallic blue box on the counter, without even saying
hello.
     Jeffrey knew  at that  instant he was being set up.  Cheryl never
had anything  to do  with the technical staff.  He had seen her around
the building often enough, but learned quickly of her distaste for the
techies, and  had properly ignored her ever since.  Undoubtedly one of
the IDT  managers got  a carbon-copy of the MCI letter and sent Cheryl
in to  cheer Jeffrey  up, rather  than stopping  in themselves.    How
unthoughtful.   He didn't  want to  be cheered  up.   Cheryl was still
standing there,  though, and  Jeffrey racked his mind to remember what
she had asked him.
     "Yes, that's it."
     Cheryl didn't waste a second.  "It doesn't work, huh?"
     Nice cheering-up  job, Jeffrey  thought.   He answered  in a tone
normally reserved for when you lose your best friend.  "It works fine.
It just  doesn't work  for everyone,  that's all.   All the government
people who  tested it  were so skeptical, so narrow-minded it couldn't
have possibly  worked."    He  wondered if  he was rationalizing it or
not.
     Cheryl continued  her insistent questions as if she had a list of
them.  "It works for you?"
     "Yes.  And most other people can use it too."
     "Oh."   It sounded like she just ran out of questions.  "Sorry to
be ignorant.   I just don't pay much attention to what our experiments
do, that's all."
     Jeffrey reached  behind him  and picked  up the  Device.  "Have a
seat", he  said, pointing  to a  chair across  from him.   Cheryl sat.
"All it  is, primarily,  is a  thought amplifier.   It  looks to  what
you're thinking,  and retransmits  it so  that you  can  see  it  more
clearly.   But the big advantage is that it transmits to others within
a few feet.  Want a sample?"
  
  
                             *** Chapter 3 ***
     Cheryl nodded  without saying  a word.  Jeffrey started his long-
rehearsed demonstration  speech, required  so that  the visitors would
know what's  going on  and would  have some  margin of  safety  should
something go wrong.
     "Touch your  finger here  for a  second", he  said, pointing to a
small metal circle on top of the Device, which was in his lap.  Cheryl
did.   "All you  did was  allow the  device  to  calibrate  itself  to
your..." (he  hated the  oversimplification)... "'wavelength',  so you
can participate.   You  know what  the Device does, and it's easier to
show you  it's abilities  than to  tell you.   All you have to know is
this:   This box  cannot reproduce  itself in this color in your mind.
It's a  safety device  that took  almost nine months to install.  If I
were to try to fool you into thinking that the demonstration was over,
you'd notice  that the box was red, not blue, because it won't let you
see it  any other  way.   There's a timer on the top that will end the
  
demonstration in..."  (he set  the timer) "about ten minutes.   That's
another safety  device in  case for  some reason  I can't turn it off.
It'll also turn off on any sort of sensory disturbance, so you have to
be comfortable  before you  can start."   He elected to omit the usual
comment about  using the  rest-room first.   "The  final safety device
limits the  amount of  pain and  suffering you can feel no matter what
happens to  you.   In the  image that the box presents, you could stab
yourself with  a knife  and would feel only momentary discomfort.  And
of course,  you wouldn't  sustain any real-life damage.  That prevents
the Device from being used to torture someone, for the most part.  Now
just clear your mind for a moment, and relax."
     He looked up at her.  She closed her eyes.  He stole a quick peek
at her uncrossed legs and the space between them, that had crossed hi
mind many  times before.   Why  didn't she  like the technical people?
Such a  waste.   Oh well.   He  leaned back  and pressed the switch to
start the demonstration, then put his hands at his sides.
     He opened  his eyes.   "Cheryl?"   She opened hers without saying
anything.   The box was red, instead of blue.  It was incredible-- she
could have,  by any other measure, been actually sitting there staring
at a  red box  there with  Jeffrey.  But no, the box was blue, and her
eyes were closed.  It just SEEMED that way.  She moved her arms.  They
moved.  Fingers too.
     "Everyone always  does that",  Jeffrey giggled.    "Obviously  it
works with  you.   Yes, everything seems normal.  Your fingers wiggle.
And no,  they aren't really wiggling in real life.  But, for now, they
might as well be."
     "Incredible.  You did this?"
     Jeffrey smiled.   "Yup.   Three  years for this.  But you haven't
seen anything yet!"
     They both  got up.  Just as they got to their feet, the walls and
ceiling of  the building  vanished, revealing  the trees, sky, clouds,
and such  outside.   It may  have  been  41  degrees  on  the  outdoor
thermometer 5 minutes ago, but it was a comfy 70 or so now.
     "How did that happen?"
     "Easy.   I just  decided that  the walls should go away, and even
before I  imagine it  happening, it  does.   The Device reads what I'm
thinking, and makes it seem like it's happening.  It was all so simple
once we got the basic theories straight.  Notice how there's no detail
left out?"
     Cheryl looked around the room (what was left of it) and nodded.
     Jeffrey continued.   "In  actuality, that's not true.  For all we
know, none  of the things we're not looking at this second exist.  But
once we  go to look at anything, the image gets filled in from our own
thoughts.  For the most part, what we see, hear, smell, feel, or taste
depends on  who looks  at it  first-- it fills in the detail from that
person's memory.  The other person sees that as the first imagined it.
But the  person who's  holding  the  physical  box  has  the  ultimate
authority.  Watch."  A small metal box appeared on the counter, with a
lid that  was closed.   "There's  an index card inside that box with a
four-digit number  on it,"  he said,  "but I  don't know  what  it  is
because I  haven't decided on one.  Why don't you open the box and see
what it says?
     Cheryl walked  over  to  the  box  while  Jeffrey  looked  around
outside.  It was mid-afternoon.  Some birds flew nearby, something not
formerly present.
     "It's 9601,  the last  four digits  of my  phone number",  Cheryl
reported.  How did that happen?"
     "Either because  you wanted  it to, or because the Device decided
that it  was the  most likely  thing to  put there.  I don't know your
phone number and couldn't have put it there.  See?"
     Again, Cheryl  just nodded.   With  that, the numbers on the card
changed  to   2066,  Jeffrey's   office  extension  number.    Jeffrey
explained.  "You might create something out of your imagination... but
if there is a conflict, the box-holder gets his way with reality.  The
problem with  the tests was that the people who tried it either didn't
have the  imagination (faith  if you like) to make the device work for
them, in which case the only effect they ever saw was the box changing
color, or  they couldn't mentally lock on to the signals from the box,
which meant that even THAT didn't happen."  Again, did he really know?
Maybe not.   It  could take  years of  research.   Oh well.  "Come on,
let's go."
  
  
                            *** Chapter 4  ***
     Cheryl wheeled  around and discovered that Jeffrey had sprouted a
perfect pair  of wings,  feathers and all.  It was one of his favorite
diversions, which  he had developed after weeks of testing.  He picked
Cheryl up  from behind;  his arms  fitting into  the somewhat innocent
space below  her breasts.   She  was very light because he had decided
that she  should be,  at least for now.  She didn't complain about it.
In an instant Jeffrey cringed down, and leapt into the air.
     It was  too fast  for Cheryl, who felt that the exciting part had
been rushed.   They were already fifty feet above the ground, coasting
over the  trees towards  downtown.   With a  few flaps, Jeffrey lifted
them both to several times that altitude.  "Nervous?" he asked.
     "No, I'm  fine."   It wasn't  convincing.   The only other person
he'd ever  taken on  this tour  couldn't take  it too  well.   Jeffrey
pitched upwards  a little  bit and  slowed down, then gained some more
altitude, and  generally swooped  around  a  bit.    The  scenery  was
breathtaking, and the feeling was unparalleled.
     "Afraid of  heights?"   Jeffrey remembered  how he had thought of
the Device  as a  tool to eliminate such fears, the last time he asked
that question.  Cheryl didn't answer.
     With nothing  to lose  as far as Cheryl's opinion of him, Jeffrey
did the  only thing  he could  think of  to remedy the situtation.  He
dropped her.   Cheryl screamed, fell a few feet, and stopped in midair
at Jeffrey's  command.   She couldn't  have done  that  herself.    He
stopped in  midair and had her float up to him, facing him.  "You see?
There's nothing  to be  afraid of.   You  can't get  hurt here.  And I
wouldn't let you get hurt anyway.
     She didn't look resentful.  She looked down at the streets below,
then reached  down as  if to  see what  was holding her up.  It always
seemed to  take a  while for  people to  get  "the  idea"--  that  the
constraints of reality no longer hold.
     "It can  be like  an amusement  park-- thrills without danger, or
whatever amuses  you."   Cheryl was  now smiling.   It  was  time  for
Jeffrey to try and promote that idea.  It was no fun here with someone
that didn't  understand, and  it looked  like Cheryl was beginning to.
Jeffrey continued.   "Take my hand," he said.  "I think you've got the
idea."
     She did.   Jeffrey's  wings disappeared.   A  moment  later  they
started falling,  from the  five thousand feet (funny, we weren't that
high up  a moment  ago) to the town below.  Jeffrey looked straight at
Cheryl.   She looked  up at  him.   It had  worked!   She felt  enough
confidence in  him to  be able  to take  her eyes  off the approaching
Earth.  He couldn't keep his feeling to himself.
     "I'm impressed,  Cheryl.   You've got more inside than I credited
you for.  Congratulations."  He pulled her to him, and held her tight.
She wrapped her arms around him, and looked down.
     Just before  they reached  the  earth,  a  large  pool  of  water
appeared below them and they splashed harmlessly into it, coming to an
almost instant  stop.  Cheryl, who had let go just as they reached the
water, paddled  back over  to Jeffrey  and grabbed onto him again.  He
liked the feeling where she was pressing against him.
     Finally, she  spoke up  again.   "Can we  try it  again?  Not the
fall, I mean, but flying around?  I'd like to try it out for myself."
     Jeffrey nodded.   A  moment later,  they were both in midair, and
Cheryl had  developed some  nice orange  feathers.   Jeffrey  followed
Cheryl as  she flew  back towards  the company,  swooped down over the
trees, and  shrieked with  excitement.   "I want  to try landing", she
said.   "Will you go first?"  Jeffrey agreed, and lined up in front of
her, feet down, heading for the flat roof of IDT's main building.
     Then he was sitting in a chair, with the blue box on his lap.  He
looked at  the top  of it.   "Timer's...  No, there's still time left,
must be..."   He  looked towards  the door.  His supervisor had walked
in, and  the noise  had tripped the sensory-monitor device, ending the
simulation.
     "Good night, you two.  Lock up the lab when you leave, OK?"
     Jeffrey and Cheryl both nodded.  Jeff added a "Good night" as the
supervisor was on the way out the door.  As the door closed, he turned
to Cheryl  once again.   "Always  happens that way...  There were only
about 30 seconds left anyway."
     "That certainly  seemed like more than four and a half minutes!",
Cheryl exlaimed.
     "It always  does seem  longer," Jeffrey  agreed.   "It  would  be
impossible to test, though, right?  A simulated clock would go just as
fast as  you would  imagine it  to go.  Everything else could speed up
too.  It just seems to be the way people think."
     Surprisingly, although  it was  a few  minutes after five, Cheryl
wasn't leaving like Jeffrey expected her to.  Did she really feel like
spending time  with Jeffrey?  Maybe her opinion about techie types had
changed a bit.
     "Can we try it again?  Everyone's gone now and I just had so much
fun with you...?
  
  
                             *** Chapter 5 ***
     Jeffrey couldn't  get his  mind off  the words  'with  you'  very
easily.  "Sure, I'm in no hurry tonight."  He started to reach for the
timer controls again, and Cheryl interrupted.
     "Could I do it this time?  You did it last time, and..."
     Jeffrey nodded  and handed the box to her, touching the circle on
the top  after setting  it in  her lap.  "We just set the timer for as
long as we want-- maybe ten minutes would be better this time, and..."
     Cheryl didn't  wait for  the explanation.   She set the timer for
four hours,  sat back.  An instant later, the box turned red.  Jeffrey
got up,  startled, and  noticed the  timer was set for 4:00, not 0:10.
"How come you--"
     "Because I don't want to be interrupted again.  I can turn it off
anytime before four hours runs out, right?"
     "Yes-- you  just IMAGINE  you're holding the box, and are turning
it off,  and it  does.   Maybe we should do that, and fix the timer--"
Jeffrey reached  for the box, but it vanished from Cheryl's lap before
he could  reach it.   She  had made  it disappear.  She could bring it
back, but he couldn't.  He felt uncomfortable at the prospect.
     "I just want to play a while.  I'm SURE you won't mind.  You said
you weren't going anyplace."  Pointing to her lap, she added:  "Pretty
good, huh?"
     "Um... Yes",  said Jeffrey,  obediently staring at her lap.  "OK,
then, let's see what you can do.  Want to go flying again?"
     "Not right  now.   I was  just thinking  how you  can do anything
here-- like  flying before.   Anything."  She looked straight into his
eyes.  "Must be pretty good when your company's getting horny, huh?"
     At first,  Jeffrey thought she was talking about him.  After all,
the thought  had  crossed  his  mind  since  they  first  started  the
adventure.   But no, he hadn't expressed that thought.  Then maybe she
was just  being hypothetical.   But  the tone of her voice was telling
him otherwise.  He didn't know what to say.
     Cheryl stood  up, and  wrapped  her  arms  around  him,  pressing
herself against  him.   "Remember?  In the air?  It was your idea, not
mine.   I don't  know whether it was all the adrenalin, the thrill, or
you personally.   And  I don't  know how  you  felt,  but  it  got  me
positively wet between the legs.  Even if I was just imagining it."
     Jeffrey restrained  himself at  the thought  of that wetness.  He
had felt  a little  something, but  at the same time was worried about
being a little too forward.  But he had to say something.  "Isn't this
a little...  fast?   I like you a lot.  But two weeks ago you wouldn't
have given me the time of day, much less admit what you just said."
     "Maybe.   I never really thought about you at all until about two
weeks ago.   I don't know why.  I guess I started feeling guilty about
the reasons I DIDN'T pay attention to some people.  So, it seemed like
the perfect  opportunity when  Dan asked me to see how you were doing.
And..." (she  ran one hand across his bottom) "...what a better way to
meet?   Perfectly romantic."   They  were standing on a boat, facing a
setting sun,  with a  violin playing  in the  background.  "Or however
else it  should be."   The corny sunset-boat-violin scene disappeared,
leaving total  darkness except  for themselves.    "Much  better  than
meeting in a laundromat."   Sounded rational.
     Of course, rational was the last thing on Cheryl's mind.  Jeffrey
had his  arms around her.  He slid his hands down across her derriere,
feeling the  soft fabric  of the jeans she was wearing.  She seemed to
approve.  But she let go of him.  She stood back a foot or so.
     Slowly, and  tauntingly, Jeffrey's  clothes began  to fade  away.
First his  shirt, then  his slacks,  and without  any hesitation,  his
underwear  began   to  become  transparent,  revealing  everything  to
Cheryl's eyes.   He  couldn't bring  his clothes  back.   The  awkward
situation made him lose what erection he had.
     "Neat", Cheryl  exclaimed.  "I just have to imagine it starting--
your clothes disappearing-- and unless I stop it, it happens by itself
without me helping".
     At first,  Jeffrey though "Neat" was referring to his naked body.
But then  he realized  that he was an unwilling accomplice to Cheryl's
vanishing-clothes trick.   She had never seen him naked before, and so
the vision  that she  now  saw  was  constructed  from  Jeffrey's  own
thoughts.   He was  beginning, more and more, to feel like the student
in this  environment, when before he was only the teacher.  He'd never
done anything quite like this in the demonstration--
     Cheryl's voice  interrupted his thoughts again.  The sexy tone in
her voice  had returned.     "YOU'RE neat  TOO, you  know."   She  was
staring, unashamed,  at his previously private areas.  She walked back
up, still  dressed, and  touched his  penis.  He didn't complain.  She
looked at him straight in the eyes, and made her own blouse disappear,
slowly like  before.   No bra--  just two  very  nice  tits  were  now
visible.  She still looked straight into Jeffrey's eyes, watching them
sweep down  her body,  hesitate, then  look back up into her eyes.  "I
want to  see you  get hard.   I want it to happen right here.  Bigger,
harder than you ever have before."
     Jeffrey obliged  her.   He felt himself starting to stretch right
in her  hand, growing,  getting warm,  and longer.  Her grip tightened
  
around him  as he  grew.   He ran  his eyes over her chest freely now,
using the  stimulation to  carry out  Cheryl's request.    Finally  he
reached up and touched her breasts, which somehow seemed to excite him
more than  her.   Her attention  was on his growing member.  He rubbed
his fingers,  then hands,  then both hands over her tits, watching her
nipples grow erect at his fingertips.
     She let  go of  him.   It felt  cold now,  but his  penis  didn't
wither.   Cheryl stood back, again, and this time revealed the rest of
herself to  him.   Jeffrey's eyes, as one might expect, focused on the
little patch  of brown  hair between her legs-- as his mind focused on
the infinite pleasure just beyond.
     At this  point Jeffrey's  mind was  so  fixed  on  the  impending
copulation, that  even the unnatural absence of background didn't seem
unnatural anymore.   This  wasn't imagination;  it was reality.  There
was Cheryl,  and Jeffrey, and that was all.  Nothing else.  And Cheryl
had decided,  apparently, that  there was  only one thing to be done--
and it  was just  minutes away.  He was impatient-- knowing that those
minutes would seem SO LONG -- until he finally reached his goal.
  
  
                             *** Chapter 6 ***
     Cheryl's voice was the sexiest he'd heard yet.  "Touch me.  Touch
me all over.  You know what I want.  You know what to do so I get it."
Jeffrey slid  one arm  around her,  pulling him  to her.    Her  bosom
pressed into his chest again, and he could feel her nipples stiffening
against him.   He wrapped his other arm around her, and slid his hands
over her  buttocks.   It was something he never thought he'd be doing.
A few seconds later they were both floating, weightless.
     Cheryl kissed  him, sliding  her tongue into his mouth, exploring
it.   Her hands  went to his bottom also, one hand between his bowels,
rubbing the  area around  his anus.   Nobody  had ever  done  that  to
Jeffrey before; he liked it.
     Jeffrey's hands approached her pussy.  It seemed warm even before
he touched the hair around it.  He could smell her wetness.  The scent
was making him lose what little control he had left.  He hesitated for
a moment,  giving himself  final clearance  to  proceed,  then  probed
through her pubic hair, touching the skin between her legs.  He rubbed
the area for a minute before one finger felt her pussy's lips.  It was
wet inside.   He  spread them  apart, and  touched it.   After  a  few
seconds he knew what was where...  She clenched him as one finger slid
by her clitoris; and when a finger finally discovered the opening into
her vagina,  she grabbed  his hand  and pushed  his finger inside.  He
slid it back and forth.  His other hand was now on her breasts.
     Cheryl came  after just  a few  seconds.   She  pushed  his  hand
against her.   He  felt a ripple inside her as her muscles contracted.
She held him there for a moment, then let him slide out.
     "Lick me," she demanded.  "Learn what I taste like."
     Jeffrey wasn't  bothered by  that prospect.  He floated away from
her for  a second,  then she  floated towards  him, aiming  her  pussy
towards his  head.   As he  started to  slide between  her thighs, she
locked her  legs around him, squeezing him, locking him in place.  Sh
was getting  him wet.   His  tongue instantly  found its target, first
sliding across  her clitoris,  and then  inside.    He  swallowed  her
juices.   She came  again, squeezing with her legs so hard that, for a
minute, he  couldn't breathe.   Her  pussy surrounded  him.   He  felt
another surge  of liquid from within her.  As soon as it was over, she
released him, and they floated alongside each other.  She had regained
some of  her control;  yet  now  her  pussy  was  aiming  towards  his
previously ignored  cock.   She held on to him, and pulled him towards
her, keeping a careful eye on his navigation.
     Jeffrey seemed  to have  some reservations.   He hardly knew her,
really, and  that thought  was starting  to surface.  That thought got
through to  Cheryl, who  knew better--  that they both wanted the same
thing and there was no reason not to have it.
     "You have no choice now."  The distance between their pubic areas
continued to  reduce.   "Besides, I  know what you want.  You wouldn't
have gone  this far.   You're  not getting  away now.   You want me as
much as I want you."  She was right.
     Jeffrey insisted,  though, not  because  he  was  unwilling,  but
because he  was afraid that she'd regret it later, and would blame him
for it.   "It's too fast.  Why are you rushing?  I want to learn about
you... get to know you..."
     Cheryl didn't  listen.   Jeffrey's penis  touched the hair around
her pussy.   Then he felt the warmth at the tip of it.  His cock still
had some  flexibility to it. In a short time-- almost too fast, Cheryl
took him  inside.  The heat made him grow very hard, conforming to her
shape.   She started to wrap her legs around him, and to slide against
him.   He grabbed  her body,  realizing that it was the last chance to
save his  rational self, and stopped her from moving.  He concentrated
on everything but the fact that they were now mating.
     She resented  the fact  that he  was  forcibly  interrupting  her
pleasure.   But it  did return  her faculties  to her,  long enough to
realize once again that this wasn't really happening, and that she was
in control  of things.   She  hadn't heard what Jeffrey said, but this
time decided  quite consciously to continue.  She could show her anger
now without  Jeffrey being able to do anything about it.  Besides, she
knew that  he was  struggling to  hang on to his mind, while her pussy
did its work on him, her breasts and body draining his willpower.
     "Shut up.   It's  too late.  I'm screwing you and there's nothing
you can  do to  stop me."  The words, she figured, would send him over
the edge  and he'd stop resisting.  Jeffrey never thought he'd ever be
in the situation of resisting a beautiful woman's advances, unless she
was married  or had  some disease  or something.   But neither was the
case now.
     Her words  were a  temptation of defial.  He placed both hands on
her hips,  and started to push her away, hoping she'd forgive him, and
even be  thankful that  he gave her a chance to think rationally about
her actions.   His  penis started  to slide out.  The tip was swelling
inside her,  though, at  Cheryl's command.    Jeffrey  felt  his  skin
stretching.   He didn't know how big he was, and he wouldn't feel much
pain as long as the Device was working.
     Cheryl's orifice  tightened around  the base of his cock.  It had
grown inside  her, and  she was  growing tighter.   He  pushed  harder
against her  hips, but  couldn't slide out.  He was locked inside her.
He slid  back in  to try again, and this time the sensation of sliding
into her  warm flesh  pushed him  over the  edge.   Her words had come
true.   He lost  his last  reasons for  stopping it,  and his thoughts
faded with  only one intense purpose remaining.  He started sliding in
and out, making no further attempts to escape.
     Cheryl giggled  once.  "That's it, animal.  Fuck me.  Then, maybe
I'll let  you go."  It was all a game, Jeffrey and Cheryl both knowing
the rules  quite well.   Each  word, each motion, could do nothing but
stimulate  desire.    Jeffrey's  attempt  to  "stop"  her  was  played
perfectly.   He probably  knew it  would excite  her.  And now, he was
hers, undulating  against her,  and pulsating inside her.  She giggled
again once  more, watching  Jeffrey turn  into the  animal she wanted,
before her  own thoughts  turned again towards the act of mating.  She
grew hot inside as the excitement increased.
     Cheryl was approaching her climax, but still had a handle on what
was happening.   Her  words came  one at  a time, with each breath and
  
each of  Jeffrey's thrusts.   "I..  want.. all  of.. you...   inside..
deep.. yes..."
