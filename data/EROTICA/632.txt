The Birthday Gift:  Part One (Friday Night 11:00 pm)

     Josephine Eileen Ross stood jauntily in  the entrance  to the 
crowded  nightclub,  her  right  hand  on  her  hip  --   a  tall, 
stunningly attractive woman.  She wore a  black, velvet  decollete 
evening dress with a high fan  collar that  accentuated her  ample 
cleavage and slim, hour-glass figure.  Her  full lips  matched the 
color of her long, curved red  fingernails, and  she had  on black 
silk stockings  and high-heeled  stiletto opera  pumps.  Her  long 
black hair danced on her shoulders.  For jewelry, Josie wore a set 
of gold  hoop earrings  and an  intricate platinum  choker.  Josie 
looked at her image in the  foyer mirror  and smiled  confidently.  
She was dressed to kill, and she knew it.
     After waiting a few minutes, Josie saw an  empty seat  at the 
main bar and took it.  The bartender, a  young curly-haired  girl, 
saw her and came up.  "What can I get you, miss?"
     Josie thought for a moment. "I'd like a martini -- very dry."
     After she ordered, Josie took out  a pack  of Virginia  Slims 
from her purse and pulled out a long white cigarette.
     The bartender brought her drink over, set it  down, and  held 
up a lighter.  "Here, I'll get that."
     Josie held the cigarette to her lips as  the other  woman lit 
it  for  her.   Josie  inhaled  deeply,  her breasts  rising.  She 
expelled a thin stream of blue smoke toward the ceiling and smiled 
at the girl.  "Thank you," she said.
     The bartender smiled back.  "You're welcome."
     Josie crossed her legs,  sipped her  drink and  took a  long, 
luxurious drag  on her  cigarette.  Her  left hand  slipped subtly 
beneath the folds of  her dress,  and her  fingers felt  along her 
thigh.  Halfway  up, connected  to a  thick elastic  strap, was  a 
clamshell case containing various  accoutrements.  Satisfied  that 
it was secure, Josie removed her  hand and  took out  a photograph 
from  her  purse.  It  was a  shot of  two women,  a blonde  and a 
brunette.  The brunette was her employer; it was  the blonde  that 
Josie  sought  tonight,  a  sloe-eyed,  large-breasted  girl named 
Patricia Ortiz.
     Josie  took  another drag  on her  cigarette and  scanned the 
mirror in front of her, looking  at the  crowd.  It  was a  Friday 
night, and the room was dense with people.  Almost all were women, 
which  wasn't  surprising  for  a lesbian  nightclub.  There  were 
several gorgeous women out on the dance floor.  As Josie  watched, 
she  felt  a  familiar  warmth  swelling  up within  her.  As  she 
strained  over  to get  a better  look, she  noticed a  young girl 
sitting  at  the opposite  end of  the bar,  wearing a  tight blue 
leotard top and white faille wraparound skirt.  It was Patricia.
     She had already decided her strategy. She finished  her drink 
and cigarette, and the bartender, who  kept giving  Josie discrete 
glances, came over immediately.  "Can I get you another one?"  she 
asked.
     "Yes, please," Josie said, "and do me a favor."
     The bartender smiled.  "I'd love to."
     "Do  you  see  that  woman  over  there?",  Josie  pointed to 
Patricia.  "Give her another drink with my compliments."
     The girl nodded.  "You mean Trish?  Sure."
     Josie took  out another  cigarette, along  with a  long ebony 
cigarette holder.  She carefully inserted the  cigarette into  the 
holder and lit it.  "Tell her it's from me."
     "Okay," the  bartender told  her, "but  I have  to warn  you, 
Trish is into some very heavy scenes."
     "That's what I was hoping," Josie  said, her  eyes sparkling.  
The bartender looked surprised, but said nothing.
     Josie watched as the  bartender took  a scotch  on the  rocks 
over  to  Patricia and  set it  down in  front of  her, discreetly 
pointing over  to Josie.   Patricia looked  over, smiling.   Josie 
returned the smile, nodded and took a long drag  on her  cigarette 
holder.  She was beginning  to get  a kick  out of  this, and  her 
heart began to race  when Patricia  stood up,  drink in  hand, and 
sidle through the crowd.  It took her a  few moments,  but finally 
she was there, standing before Josie.
     "Hello," she said.  "Thanks for the drink."
     "My pleasure," Josie said.  "I couldn't  help but  notice you 
over there -- you're a very attractive woman."
     Patricia  looked  a little  startled.  "Are  you always  this 
forward?"
     Josie finished her cigarette.  "I am tonight."
     Patricia smiled  again.  "Why  don't we  find a  quiet corner 
somewhere?"  She offered her hand, and Josie took it, slipping off 
the barstool, her metal-tipped stilettos clacking on the floor.
     They found a dimly-lit table on a dais overlooking the  dance 
floor and sat down  side by  side.  Josie  lit the  candle in  the 
middle of the table and pulled it over so she  could see  Patricia 
better.  As she did so, Josie noticed the  other woman's  nipples, 
erect and perfectly outlined in the sheer material of her top.
     Patricia took a sip  of her  drink.  "My  name's Trish,"  she 
said.  "What's yours?"
     "Josephine, but I go by Josie."
     "Josie;  what  a lovely  name."  She  paused.  "This  is your 
first time here."
     Josie looked up into her eyes.  "Why would you think that?"
     Trish smiled.  "Believe me, I would remember seeing you."
     "I'll take that as a compliment."
     "God, yes," Trish said heavily.  She let her hand fall  below 
the table to rest on Josie's thigh.  "I saw you sitting at the bar 
earlier tonight...I thought you looked very, very sexy."
     "Thank you," Josie said.
     "All dressed in black,  and using  that long  black cigarette 
holder," Trish continued.  "Very elegant."
     Josie smiled.   "My mother  gave it  to me.   She thought  it 
makes me look like a vamp."
     "Well," Trish  said, her  hand sliding  along Josie's  inside 
thigh, "it sure does wonders for me."
     Josie  covered  Trish's  hand  with  her  own, and  guided it 
beneath the folds of her dress.   "Then this  might be  your lucky 
night."  With her other hand, she reached into her purse  and took 
out an engraved invitation.  She opened  it deftly  and passed  it 
over to Trish.  "Read this."
     Trish took the invitation and held it over the candle.


                    Darling Patrica (it read),

            You are formally invited  to a weekend  of
            extreme sensuality  and forbidden delights
            on the  occasion  of your  28th  birthday.

            The woman from whom you have received this
            is your mistress and guide. She is trained
            in all forms of ecstasy which  you desire.

            Place all faith in her.  Obey  all of  her
            instructions without fail.  Do so, and you
            will experience sexual delight unlike none
            you have ever imagined.  Disobey her,  and
            you will be punished in ways that you have
            dreamt of and more.

                             Signed,

                          Elizabeth Bach

      P.S.  Patricia, I love you.  I give you your fantasy.


     Trish set  the note  down.  "I  need a  cigarette," she  said 
finally.   Her  fingernails  were  beginning to  dig into  Josie's 
thigh.
     Josie laughed and passed a cigarette over to Trish and lit it 
for her, then put one in her holder and lit it.
     "Where is Elizabeth?" Trish asked.
     "All in due time," Josie said.  "First, I need your consent."
     "She  told  me  she  might do  this," Trish  said, almost  to 
herself.  "I had no idea..."  She paused.  "What do I need to do?"
     "Just say yes or no.  If you agree,  you will  do whatever  I 
command for..." she looked  at her  watch; it  was eleven  thirty.  
"For the next forty eight hours.  We will return you to reality on 
this time, Sunday night."
     "What about my cats?"
     Josie laughed again.  "Every detail's been  seen to;  believe 
me.  All you have to do is agree.  If you say yes,  I'll give  you 
one hour, and then the festivity begins."
     Trish sat silently for a moment.  "You know Elizabeth well?"
     "Your Significant Other?  Yes, we've known  each other  since 
school."
     "Alright,  then,"   Trish  said   nervously,  but   her  eyes 
positively shone with anticipation.  "You have my agreement."
     "Very well,"  Josie replied.   "You look  like you've  seen a 
ghost; would you like to dance?"
     A slow  song was  starting up.   "I'd love  to," Trish  said.  
They stood  up and  went out  to the  dance floor,  hand in  hand.  
Josie slipped her arm around Trish's  waist and  pulled her  close 
gently, reveling in the other woman's musky smell.
     The  song  was  one  of Josie's  favorites.  "Antes  que seja 
tarde..." the lead went, and she looked down  into Trish's  bright 
eyes.  Without warning, Trish's mouth opened  to an  O, and  Josie 
kissed her.  It was a soft kiss, and Josie felt Trish trembling as 
their lips met.  Trish pulled back  and leaned  into Josie's  ear.  
"Elizabeth..." she whispered.
     Josie took her hand  and gave  it a  gentle squeeze.   "She's 
given me her consent,  darling.  Do  not feel  unfaithful to  her.  
Everything that happens, has her best wishes.  She  just wants  to 
give you what you couldn't ask for directly."  She paused.   "Now, 
kiss  me  again," she  said, but  before she  could finish,  Trish 
pulled  her  closer  and  put  her  mouth on  Josie's, her  tongue 
hungrily probing.  Josie responded with a hunger of  her own,  and 
for a time they were only aware of each other.
     Finally they parted.  Josie heard another song from  the same 
album starting ("Depois Dos  Temporais").  They  had embraced  for 
almost twenty minutes.
     "God," Trish said.  "I think I need to  sit for  a moment;  I 
think I've wet myself."
     They went back to their table and sat  down.  There  was line 
of  perspiration  going  down  Trish's  back,  but  Josie   looked 
completely composed.
     As Trish lit another cigarette, Josie said, "Do you know what 
a safeword is?"
     Trish nodded.  "Elizabeth and  I've used  one before,  during 
our...scenes."
     Josie took another small envelope from  her purse  and handed 
it to her.  "Here are the safewords we  will use.   They apply  to 
both  of  us.   You  must  understand  --"  She  paused.  "If  the 
safeword is spoken to you, you will stop  immediately whatever  it 
is you are doing.  If your partner is bound, you will unbind  her.  
If your  partner is  unable to  speak, be  alert to  the nonverbal 
signal."
     Trish  opened  the  envelope  and read  the note  inside.  "I 
understand, Josie."
     "Finally, one last thing."  Josie lit a cigarette  and sipped 
her drink.  "Much of what we will do is psychodrama.  By giving me 
your consent, you have given yourself completely to me.  I will do 
everything possible to heighten your pleasure.   My first  command 
is to trust in me totally."
     "I do," Trish said huskily.
     "Now,  I  ask you  to remember  the final  safeword --   it's 
written on the back of the note you're  holding.  My  instructions 
from Elizabeth are that, if you utter it, you are  to be  released 
immediately  and  returned here,  to your  car.  Trish,  remember: 
There is no going back.  If I hear it, the  festivity comes  to an 
irrevocable end."
     "I understand."
     Josie  looked  at  her  watch.   It  was  12:28.   She smiled 
devilishly.  "Are you ready?"
     "God, yes, darling!"
     "Then," Josie  said, "let  the games  begin."  She  stood up.  
"You will find a black limousine  parked in  front.  Leave  within 
the next fifteen minutes  and take  a seat  in the  back.  Do  not 
disturb the driver at all."  She picked up her purse.  "I will see 
you again soon.  Remember:  Do not speak to the driver."
     "Yes, Josie."
     Josie looked down at her.  "I am a  dominatrix; from  now on, 
you will address me as 'mistress.'"
     "Yes, mistress."
     Josie turned  and left  her sitting  there.  She  walked out, 
without looking back.
     Trish held the note in front of her, over the candle.  Before 
looking at the back, she slowly dipped it into the  flame and  set 
it in the ashtray, watching as the fire consumed it.  Then she too 
stood up, crushed her  cigarette out,  and walked  briskly through 
the crowd to the entrance and out the door.

The Birthday Gift:  Part Two (Saturday Morning 1:00 am)

     Josie undressed slowly, carefully laying out her garments  on 
the bed, to be taken care of earlier.  She was  now totally  nude, 
except for the clamshell case strapped to her  thigh.  She  picked 
up a black cire bustier from the bed and laced it up;  it squeezed 
her breasts together and jutted them out.  Next came matching cire 
panties and a pair of skintight  black lycra  open-fingered gloves 
that went up to the elbow.  Satisfied with  her appearance  in the 
mirror by the bed,  she sat  down and  pulled on  a pair  of shiny 
patent leather  high-heeled boots.   To complete  the outfit,  she 
took out a long, pointed dagger and scabbard, which she buckled on 
to her right leg, right above the boot.  Finally, she picked up an 
ornate riding crop and tested it by putting  the strap  around her 
wrist and flicking it through the  air.  It  made a  loud cracking 
sound as it struck the bed.
     As she checked her lipstick and makeup in  the mirror,  Josie 
heard a car pull up in the driveway.  She looked  out the  window; 
it was the limousine.  She watched  as the  chauffeur got  out and 
opened the rear door.  Trish emerged, said something  to him,  and 
went to the door.
     Josie stood at the top of the stairway, riding crop  in hand.  
"Patricia."
     Trish looked up.  "Mistress!"
     Josie beckoned with her finger.  "Come here."
     Trish  came  up, her  eyes devouring  Josie.  "Perfect,"  she 
purred.  She held out her hand to Josie, who deftly avoided it.
     "Follow me," was all Josie said.  She led Trish to  the guest 
bedroom and opened the door.
     "You'll find your new clothes laid out on the bed," she said.  
"Remove every item you have on now, and  put on  the new  things."  
She closed the door and sat down on a Louis XIV chair,  the riding 
crop in her lap.
     Trish  took  some  time  figuring out  the ringed  collar and 
matching lock  bracelets and  anklets, but  in a  few minutes  she 
stood before Josie in an outfit  similar to  hers, sans  weaponry.  
"Is this satisfactory?"
     Josie  stood  and tightened  up Trish's  bustier, noting  the 
swelled  nipples.   She opened  a dresser  drawer and  took out  a 
silver ball gag and  several chains,  which she  handed to  Trish.  
"Don't put them on  yet," Josie  admonished her.
     She opened the door and led Trish down the stairs, through an 
elegant living room, and to a  large wooden  beam door  bearing an 
open iron lock.  She  removed the  lock and  swung the  door open.  
Trish went through and  Josie followed,  closing the  door.  There 
was  another  stairway,  dimly  lit, leading  down into  a cellar.  
Trish looked around at the various equipment: A large metal  brace 
from which  several chains  dangled, a  gleaming silver  sex chair 
padded in  the appropriate  places, several  ornate chairs,  and a 
surgical cart covered by a black satin  sheet.  The  shining floor 
was equipped with shackle holders at regular intervals.
     While Trish examined her surroundings, Josie hit a  switch on 
the wall, causing the brace to lower.  It stopped a foot above her 
head, the chains waving slightly.
     "Raise  your  arms,"  Josie  commanded  her.   She  took  the 
apparatus that  Trish held  from her  and attached  chains to  the 
bracelets on her arms.  Trish was beginning to breathe hard.
     "Now, line  your feet  up with  the shackles  on the  floor."  
Trish's stiletto-clad feet spread out, and Josie hooked  up chains 
to her anklets.  Trish  looked out  in front  of her  and saw  her 
image  in  a  large  mirror  on  the  wall.   She sighed,  but was 
otherwise completely silent.
     Josie went back to the switch  and hit  it again.   The brace 
began to rise, causing  Trish arms  and legs  to stretch  outward.  
Josie carefully let the  brace go  just high  enough to  serve her 
purposes without discomforting Trish, then stopped it.
     She now took the  ball gag  and unhooked  it.  Trish's  mouth 
opened to an O as Josie slid it over the top of her head.  Trish's 
red  lips  covered  the  ball, and  her nostrils  flared as  Josie 
secured it.  She moaned softly when she looked at her image in the 
mirror; her nipples were now as large as cherries.
     Josie went over to the surgical cart and uncovered it.  Trish 
inhaled sharply when she saw the instruments, her eyes wide open.
     Josie picked up a small, curved  silver dildo  that glistened 
in the dim light.  As Trish  watched intently,  she lubricated  it 
with some mineral oil, then teasingly fellated it.
     Suddenly, she reached down to her  scabbard and  in one  move 
unsheathed the dagger.  Trish's body shook,  the chains  rattling.  
Kneeling down, Josie slid the sharp tip of the cold  blade beneath 
Trish's G-string and cut it, letting  it fall  to the  floor.  Her 
eyes on Trish's, she replaced the dagger in its sheath.
     Going  behind  Trish, she  knelt again  and put  her palm  on 
Trish's smooth ass.  She put her  middle finger  in her  mouth and 
drew it out as Trish watched, then placed  the tip  of it  against 
Trish's anus.  Trish consciously relaxed, and  when Josie  felt it 
was time, she slid her finger  cautiously into  Trish, who  moaned 
again.  Josie then removed it, and put the tip of the dildo  up to 
Trish's ass.   It slid  in quite  easily, and  Trish writhed  with 
pleasure against the pressure.
     Josie stood and went back in front of Trish.  She stroked her 
engorged, rock-hard nipples and smiled.  "Now, darling," she said, 
"time  to  find out  if you're  into the  philosophy, or  just the 
fashion."
     She picked up a thin black cord and wrapped it around Trish's 
neck in a constricting noose, tying  it off  on a  hook above  and 
behind Trish.  Trish's eyes darted in  anticipation, but  she made 
no sound.
     Josie's hand went down to the clamshell case on her thigh and 
flicked  it  open.   She  took out  two small  gold spring  vises. 
Opening  it  with her  fingers, she  held it  up to  Trish's right 
nipple and let it close slowly.  Trish inhaled sharply again,  her 
body shaking.
     Josie applied the other vise to Trish's left  nipple and  the 
other woman mewed quietly and began to pant through her  nostrils.  
Her  body  arched  slightly,  and  Josie  could see  that she  was 
clearly, strongly  aroused.
     Josie cupped Trish's breast in her hand and felt its  weight.  
With her other hand, she rubbed Trish's thigh.
     "How does it feel to be totally bound, darling?"
     Trish shook her head, yes.
     "And the dress?  The tight lycra gloves, the shiny boots, the 
shackles?"
     She nodded again, yes!
     Josie let  her fingers  ride gently  over Trish's  silky mons 
venus.  "Being completely dominated by another woman; that's  been 
a fantasy of yours, hasn't it?"
     Yes...yes.
     "And the ball gag.  You like that, don't you, Patricia,  your 
lips spread out against your will, gagged and hanging in midair."
     ...Yes.
     Josie  turned  and  saw  the image  of the  two of  them, she 
standing  before  Trish,  her  hands  caressing,  probing.  "Being 
filled -- except for that one, important orifice."
     Trish's eyes pleaded with Josie.
     Josie leaned down and ran her  tongue around  Trish's nipple.  
"Not yet,  darling," she  said seductively.   "That comes...later.  
For  now,  it  would  only  distract  you."   She  touched Trish's 
throbbing mons again.  "You're on the verge, now; that would  only 
send you over, and I don't want that."   Her finger  found Trish's 
clitoris almost by accident;  she pressed  playfully, and  Trish's 
body shook the brace.
     Josie rose.  "Careful, darling," she cooed.   "We still  have 
the matter  of a...punishment."   She paused,  then looked  deeply 
into Trish's eyes.  "Concentrate on the pain, Patricia.   Feel the 
vises  gripping  your nipples.   Feel the  humiliation of  hanging 
there, to be done with at my whim.  Watch yourself,  as you  crave 
my affection..."  
     Josie picked up the riding crop  by the  door and  whacked it
against her open palm.  Trish's eyes followed its movement.
     "This," Josie said, looking right at her, "is  for disobeying 
my order against talking to the driver."  She  went behind  Trish, 
and as the other woman's eyes  opened even  wider, she  raised the 
crop  and  brought  it  down whistling  violently on  Trish's ass.  
There was a loud whack! and Trish's body shook on the brace.   She 
moaned louder, and her eyes fluttered.
     WHACK! a  second time;  Trish let  out a  high-pitched sound.  
Vaginal fluid seeped down her legs.  Josie brought  the crop  down 
again with all her might...WHACK!!!
     Trish's body began to convulse.  Her back arched sharply. She 
caught Josie's eyes in the mirror and nodded, again!
     Josie brought the crop down as hard as she could, and as  the 
sharp tongues struck Trish she leaned her head forward, the  noose 
tightening.  Her body shivered, then bucked.  Her hands  fluttered 
ineffectually against  the shackles,  and when  Josie slashed  the 
crop up  between her  legs, her  lips enveloped  the ball  and she 
moaned gutterally.  She stayed suspended that  way for  almost two 
full minutes as a massive orgasm racked her body, then she slumped 
forward, panting heavily.
     Josie removed the dildo, which slid out smoothly,  and untied 
the noose.  She then undid the  nipple vises  and the  shackles on 
Trish's  legs,  noticing  that  Trish  was  still  coming.   Josie 
expertly  unhooked  the ball  gag and  set it  on the  table, then 
slipped  her  arm  around  Trish's waist  as she  disconnected the 
shackles on her arms.  Trish flung  her arms  around Josie's  neck 
and let Josie carry her to a comfortable chair in the corner.
     Trish drew up her legs, and her head  fell back,  a smile  on 
her lips; she was unconscious.
     Josie stood erect and ran her hand smoothly  along the  curve 
of  Trish's  body,  up  to  the  undersides of  her hot  and heavy 
breasts.  She too was intensely aroused; her hands went up  to her 
own breasts  and caressed  them, but  she fought  the urge  to rub 
herself.  "Later," she murmured.  "Later."
     She went to the table and picked up  a small  note pad.   She 
read to herself:

     1.  The Punishment
     2.  The Tables Turned
     3.  The Pleasure Pit
     4.  The Execution
     5.  The Pool
     6.  Return

     Josie  went  to  the  wall and  picked up  an elegant  French 
telephone.   "Elizabeth?   Josephine.   Our  young friend  is fast 
asleep.   Have  Catherine  come  down and  bring her  to the  next 
scene."
     She  hung  up  the  phone  and  looked over  at the  sleeping 
Patricia.  "Darling," she said, "will you enjoy giving as much  as 
receiving?"

The Birthday Gift:  Part Three (Saturday Afternoon 12:20 pm)

     Josie looked up when Trish walked  out onto  the patio.   She 
smiled and offered her a seat.  "How do you feel?"
     Trish returned her smile.  "Funny --" she brought a hand over 
her chest -- "but nice.  How long did I sleep?"
     Josie picked up a cigarette from a glass  case on  the table. 
"About ten hours."
     "Good God!"  Trish looked around her,  suddenly aware  of her 
surroundings.  "Where are we?"
     They sat at a table on a wood deck.  Behind them, Trish could 
see the house, with its stone walls and trimmed hedges.   To their 
left was a huge pool; to their right, a bubbling jacuzzi.  In  the 
distance, Trish could make out the Intercoastal Waterway.   It was 
a warm August afternoon.
     "We're  about  ten miles  north of  Boca Raton,"  Josie said, 
smoothing  her  hair.   She  wore  a  daringly low-cut  blue lycra 
swimsuit and white gauze robe.  In contrast to  her outfit,  Trish 
wore a white blouse and skintight black leather pants tucked  into 
a pair of high riding boots.
     Trish heard  a door  open behind  her and  turned around.   A 
petite  blonde-haired  young woman  walked out,  wearing a  maid's 
dress and carrying a tray of iced teas.   She set  it down  beside 
Josie and stood at attention.
     Josie looked up at  her.  "Thank  you, Catherine."   She held 
her cigarette to her lips and Catherine lit  it for  her.  "Trish, 
this is my servant.  Catherine, I  believe you've  met my  guest."  
To Trish:  "She helped you to bed last night."
     Trish looked up and nodded.  "Hello, Catherine."
     Catherine nodded slightly.  Without  looking up,  Josie said, 
"Offer my guest a cigarette."
     Catherine spoke softly.  "Would you care for one, mistress?"
     Trish nodded yes, and Catherine picked up the glass case  and 
held it to Trish.  Trish took a cigarette and let  Catherine light 
it for her.
     Trish expelled a thin stream of blue smoke.  "Thank you."
     Catherine turned  to Josie.   "Will there  be anything  else, 
mistress?"
     "No.  Leave us now."
     Trish watched as Catherine departed, then looked up at Josie.  
"Is she your..."
     "My slave?"  Josie smiled.  "Actually, for the weekend, she's 
your slave."
     "Mine?"  Trish thought for a moment.  "Interesting."
     "Think  of  it  as  a tiered  arrangement."  Josie  stood and 
slipped  her  robe off.   "I command  you, you  command Catherine.  
Now, I think I'll go for a swim.  As for you --" she gave  Trish a 
delicious smile.  "I want you to punish Catherine."
     "For what?"
     Josie laughed.  "You'll think of something,"  she said,  then 
dove beautifully into the pool.
     Trish sat silently for  a moment,  smoking her  cigarette and 
thinking.  Despite the ravishing  she'd received  last night,  she 
felt a familiar warmth between her legs.  Another fantasy...
     She rose abruptly and walked indoors.  "Catherine!"
     Catherine  appeared   immediately  at   the  stairs.    "Yes, 
mistress?"
     Trish put her hands on her  hips and  looked Catherine  over.  
"You're a very gorgeous young girl."
     Catherine averted her eyes.  "Thank you."
     Trish walked around her,  noting her  curvaceous body.   "How 
old are you?"
     "Twenty five, mistress."
     Trish  put  her  hand  on  Catherine's   ass.   "Very   nice, 
Catherine."
     "Thank you."
     She ran her hand up Catherine's  back, felt  her warm  flesh.  
"What are your orders?"
     "I am to be your slave."
     Trish came around front.   "Very well...it's  about time  you 
started."  She leaned against the wall.  "Touch me."
     Catherine used  her hands  to gently  touch Trish's  breasts.  
She lifted them up and felt their weight.
     Trish took Catherine's hands and pressed  them hard  onto her 
bosom.  "Like that, Catherine -- or may I call you Cat?"
     "Whatever you desire, Mistress."
     "Undress me, Cat."
     Catherine's  nimble  fingers  undid  the  buttons  to Trish's 
blouse and slipped it off, carefully  folding it.   She knelt  and 
removed Trish's boots, then slid her soft hands up Trish's  thighs 
and  unzipped  her  pants,  which  were  so tight  they had  to be 
unrolled.    Trish,   who  was   thoroughly  enjoying   this,  saw 
Catherine's hands tremble.
     "Now the brassiere and panties," Trish commanded.
     Catherine unhooked the bra and took it off, then knelt  again 
and unclasped the panties, pulling them  away.  She  looked up  at 
Trish, who was now totally nude.
     Trish looked down at her.  "Now, suck my breasts."
     Catherine's eyes lit up, and her lips encircled  Trish's left 
nipple, her teeth gently tugging.  She buried her face in  Trish's 
chest and purred.
     "Harder," Trish told her.  "Bite my nipple."
     Catherine bit down a little harder and pulled.  Trish put her 
hands in Catherine's long blonde hair and ran her fingers  through 
it.  "Yes," she said, "harder, Cat, harder..."
     Catherine's hand slid up between Trish's legs.
     Trish  suddenly  pulled  back.   "Stand up."   When Catherine 
rose, she said, "A  little too  enthusiastic, Cat.   I'm afraid  a 
little discipline is in order."
     "Yes, Mistress Patricia."
     "Follow me."
     Trish went up the stairs, with  Catherine trailing,  and into 
her room.  "Close the door behind  you," she  commanded Catherine, 
and went into the closet.
     God, she  whispered to  herself, this  house has  everything!  
She found a multitude of various instruments, costumes,  and items 
she  could  not  even  identify.  There  were lace  corsets, latex 
bustiers, gloves, boots, ropes, handcuffs, vibrators, ball gags... 
she  even  found several  anal plugs  and an  interesting strap-on 
phallus.  "Hmm," she said  to herself,  "that looks  interesting."  
After putting on a pair of  the highest  stiletto pumps  she could 
find (apparently everything in here had been measured to fit  her) 
and the gloves she had worn last night, she carefully strapped the 
strange silver device on, finding that the inside  tip managed  -- 
quite nicely -- to rest on her clitoris.  She looked  down at  the 
nine-inch  artificial  penis  jutting  from  her  pelvis and  felt 
herself growing very moist.
     But  she  needed  something  else...looking  around  the huge 
closet, she found a menacing cat  o'nine tails  against the  wall.  
That should do, she thought.
     When she came out of the  closet, Catherine  gasped, but  her 
eyes shone.
     "Get undressed," Trish told  her.  She  watched as  the other 
woman removed her dress, but when she started to unhook her garter 
belt, Trish stopped her.   "That'll do.   Now, kneel  in front  of 
me."
     Catherine went down onto her knees.
     "How do you like  my cock?"  Trish said,  grasping the  base.  
"Does this turn you on?"
     "Very much," the maid said, looking up at her.
     "Then show me how much."
     Catherine took the phallus in her mouth and  closed her  lips 
around it.  She fellated it with a slow rocking motion that caused 
it to massage Trish's clitoris.  She increased the pace, but Trish 
suddenly  broke  off.   "Now,  lie  down  on  the  bed --  on your 
stomach."
     Reluctantly, Catherine stopped and  did as  she was  ordered.  
Trish went to her arms and legs, binding  them to  the posts  with 
kid leather shackles.  She placed two  large down  pillows beneath 
Catherine's stomach, causing her ass to be raised, and leaned into 
Catherine.  Her tongue darted out and circled Catherine's sex, and 
when it  made contact  with her  clit, Catherine  emitted a  high- 
pitched squeal.
     Trish leaned back and  picked up  the whip.   She brought  it 
swiftly down on Catherine's up-ended ass.
     "Ohh..." Catherine  moaned.  Her  fingers dug  deep into  the 
soft satin comforter.
     Trish paused for a moment, feeling a pure  rush.  She  looked 
at herself in the mirror and  realized how  much she  was enjoying 
this --
     Catherine mewed again, and Trish brought the cat o'nine tails 
down harder.  Catherine's body shivered, and  a red  welt appeared 
on her buttocks.
     Trish stopped, the whip high in the air.  "Catherine, are you 
okay?"  she asked.
     Catherine turned her head to Trish.  "If mistress  would only 
hit a little harder," she replied.
     Alright, Trish thought to herself, and brought the  whip down 
yet another  time.  Catherine  bucked as  the heavy  leather cords 
struck her, and her legs flexed against the bonds.
     "Please," Catherine moaned, "harder, please!"
     Trish struck her several times more, each time a loud thwack! 
resonating in the room.  Each time Catherine cried  out for  more.  
God, Trish thought to herself, she's insatiable!
     "Mistress," Catherine groaned, "I need you!"
     Trish threw down the whip and climbed on top of  her, quickly 
mounting  her.   The curved  metal penis  slid in  softly, filling 
Catherine, who  spread her  legs and  grabbed the  bed posts  even 
tighter.
     Trish's  hands  encircled  Catherine  and  took  hold of  her 
breasts, finding the hard nipples and  pinching them  tightly with 
her fingernails.
     "Oh, yes," Catherine cried.  "God, yes!"
     Trish timed the thrusts slowly at first, increasing  her pace 
as Catherine begged her.  "Pinch me harder, mistress!"
     Trish rammed into her and twisted her nipples harder.  "Unhh, 
yes," Catherine said, "yes..."
     They both felt it at the same time: A flush  feeling, then  a 
strong wave.  Trish ground her pelvis into Catherine  and held  on 
as she came; Catherine cried out wordlessly and  arched her  back, 
panting heavily.
     An eternity  passed, then  both women  slumped down  onto the 
dripping-wet bed.  They laid like that  for a  long time,  Trish's 
lips giving kisses to Catherine's back, each lost in the other.
     Trish  had  almost  drifted  off  to  blissful  sleep,   when 
Catherine moved her legs.  "Could mistress...?"
     "Oh --  of course."  She rose to her knees slowly, her strap- 
on penis still buried in Catherine, and quickly  undid her  bonds. 
Catherine rubbed her arms, then leaned  over and  disconnected the 
apparatus from Trish.  "Mistress, you were magnificient!"
     Trish touched her chin.  "I hope I didn't hurt you too much."
     Catherine smiled.  "Do you remember last night, with mistress 
Josephine?"
     "Boy, do I!"
     "How do you feel?"
     "A little sore, maybe --" Trish paused.  "Actually,  not sore 
at all."
     "The same for me."  She looked  up in  Trish's eyes,  and her 
lips parted.  "May the slave kiss the mistress?"
     Trish put her hands on her waist and  drew her  close.  Their 
lips  met  softly,  and  as  they  kissed  their  breasts squeezed 
together.
     Trish's lips moved along Catherine's neck.  "How much time do 
we have?"
     Catherine laughed and pushed Trish off  her playfully.   "Not 
enough for what you have in mind."  She  climbed off  the bed  and 
looked at Trish as she gathered her clothes.   "Mistress Josephine 
has you on a strict schedule."
     Trish watched her dress.  "Do you know what comes next?"
     "Well," Catherine began.
     "No."  They both looked up at the door and saw Josie standing 
there in her swimsuit and robe.  "Catherine, leave us."
     Catherine's  eyes  glanced  down.    "Yes,  mistress."    She 
finished dressing and hurried out.
     Josie shut the door behind her  and stood  over the bed.
     "You seem a little harsh with  her," Trish  said.  "Does  she 
like being ordered around like that?"
     Josie smiled.   "That is  exactly what  Catherine likes:  The 
harsher, the better."  She sat down beside Trish.  "I only do what 
my partners want me to do," she explained.  "I can  be gentle  --" 
she put her hand on Trish's bare breast and stroked  it --   "or I 
can be rough."  Her fingers pinched Trish, who shuddered but  made 
no resistance.  "Do you understand?"
     "I think so."
     Josie stood and pulled  her off  the bed.   "Everything's for 
the scene," she said, and went  to the  bedstand.  She  opened the 
drawer and pulled out a black leather-topped box.  "Why don't  you 
get your bathing suit on, and we'll go for a swim."
     "Okay."   Trish  bounced  over  to  the  closet  to  look for 
something fun to wear.
     "And for the evening,"  Josie continued,  "we do  something a 
little  different."   Trish  came  out and  her eyes  opened wide.  
Josie  was  holding  a  black,  long-barreled  Beretta.  As  Trish 
watched, Josie screwed on a menacing  silencer to  the barrel  and 
showed it to her.  "Elizabeth's told me all of your fantasies."
     "She must have," Trish said, growing aroused again.
