    Breaking
    By Ourse
 
 
 "Typical," Tara muttered under her breath as she watched
her eldest sister, Kara, leave the stable.  She turned her eyes
to the latest ranch acquisition who balanced himself precariously
over the nails sticking up from the dirt floor.
 
 Brad slowly looked at the nails around and under him.  "I
can't stay like this for long," he moaned, trying to think of a
way out of the maze of nails on only his palms and toes.  With a
sign he focused on the nails in front of him.  Approaching foot-
steps made him freeze.
 
 Tara stopped at the edge of the nail maze.  "She is
pissed at you!" she declared out loud.  She strolled around the
prone male body, stopping at his feet.  Getting down on her hands
and knees, she looked between his tight jeaned legs.  She shook
her head, got up and went back to the front of his body where she
crouched down.
 
 His dark brown hair was plastered to his brow with sweat
as he glanced up at her.  He grew slightly relaxed under the
recognized gaze of his mistress' youngest sister who stared
neutrally back at him.  One of her big brown eyes winked at him.
 
 "There is a way out of this, you know."  After a silent
moment she rose to her feet.
 
 "Wait!"  He strained his head up as high as he could.
"Would you please tell me how to get out of this?"
 
 Tara folded her arms across her chest.  "No one ever
asked for my help out of one of Kara's traps before."  After
glancing around casually, she dropped to a crouch again.  "OK.
The nails are about two hand spans apart.  Move slowly to your
right -- that's the shortest distance -- I'll direct you out."
 
 For ten minutes, Brad moved slowly, lifting and setting
each hand and foot at her command.
 
 "There," she let out a long breath, "you're in the clear
now."
 
 Brad looked down at the plain, dirt floor.  He set his
knees and elbows shakily on the ground.  "Thank you, very
much..." his voice faded when he lifted his face only to find his
savior gone.  He scrambled to his feet and searched the entire
stable.  All he found was one long strand of bright red hair
which he knew only she in the Sanwick family possessed.

 Tara glanced up from the evening paper's horse breeder's
section as Kara strode angrily into the dining room.  "Who helped
him get out of the stable?" she demanded, violently yanking
Brad's leash so he fell to his knees.
 
 "Surely even he can figure out how to open the stable
doors," the middle Sanwick daughter, Mara, said quietly to her
petite, blonde lover sitting next to her.
 
 "I had a toy set up in there..." Kara started to explain
when she was interrupted by her youngest sister.
 
 "You promised to get your junk out of the stables!" Tara
said tersely over the sports page.
 
 Kara struck the table with her hand.  "You helped him!"
 
 "Quiet!"  The five young adults froze as the matron of
the Sanwick family entered.  Slowly she walked to her seat.
"When I eat with my family I expect civility!  I expect my daugh-
ters and their lovers to get along with each other!"  She sat
down with a proud smile to her right and left.  "Good evening,
children."
 
 "Good evening," all five answered in unison.
 
 Kara threw the leash at her pet as she plopped down into
her seat.  "I don't want him anymore."
 
 "It's only been four days," Mrs. Sanwick stated as she
smiled at the petite blonde.  "Do you like your stay at the ranch
so far, Darcy?"
 
 "Oh, yes, Mrs. Sanwick.  It's very lovely."
 
 "I'm taking him back to the city tomorrow," Kara stated
loudly.
 
 Brad looked up in terror at his mistress.  His blood grew
as cold as the dark nights he had spent on the street hiding from
the various hunters of the urban night.  "No, please, mistress."
His head flew back against the table from the force of his mis-
tress' slap.
 
 "Kara!"  Mrs. Sanwick's cold glare made her eldest daugh-
ter bow her head in shame.  "Brad," the matron spoke softly, "she
won't be taking you back tomorrow."
 
 Brad looked up at the greying woman with a smile.  "Thank
you, madame."
 
 "I don't want him," Kara insisted, glancing up at her
mother.
 
 "I never said you had to keep him," Mrs. Sanwick reminded
her eldest daughter.  "Tara can use him for something."
 
 "Me?"  Tara folded her paper up and set it beside her
plate.  Her eyes met his briefly before returning to her mother's
face.  "What would I use him for?"
 
 Mara chuckled softly, "Even I know that."
 
 Tara rolled her eyes at her sister.  She looked at the
man kneeling at the feet of her eldest sister then took a deep
breath.  "I suppose he could help take care of my horses and
clean out the stable."
 
 Mrs. Sanwick smiled and reached out to ruffle the man's
hair playfully.  "You see, Brad.  I told you that you wouldn't be
leaving tomorrow."
 
 "Shoveling shit, huh?"  Kara picked up her wine glass in
amusement.  "Well, maybe that is something that he can do right,"
she added with a laugh.
 
 Brad wiped his sweaty brow on his shirt sleeve and leaned
against the pitchfork.  He glanced at the dirty calendar hanging
on the stable wall near his new mistress' office door.  "It's
been three weeks and all I do is feed the horses and clean the
stable.  Well, at least it's better than my last...job."
 
 Brad pitched the last of the straw into the last stall
then placed the pitchfork back in the supply closet.  As he shut
the door, Tara walked into the stable leading her dappled mare,
Raindrop.  He hurried to the horse and took the reins from his
mistress' gloved hands.  He kept pace beside her as they led the
mare to her stall.  "How did you do today?"
 
 Tara took the ribbons and medal from her jacket pocket
and held them out for him to view.  ""Two more blues and a gold
overall," she stated simply.
 
 "You won!"  Brad exclaimed with all the excitement she
lacked.
 
 "I've won this competition the past four years in a row."
Tara rubbed Raindrop's nose before locking the door to her stall.
"You've done a good job these past weeks," she commented on the
stable to Brad, who stood by tentatively.
 
 "Thank you," Brad glanced down at his sneakers as he held
in the words he had been longing to say for the past few days.
He smiled slightly as he looked back up at her, "I'm glad you're
pleased with my work.  I can't thank you enough for keeping me."
 
 Tara shook her head.  "Come in my office for a minute,
Brad."
 
 He followed her into the office, looking at all the
medals, ribbons, and pictures of her ad her winning mounts on the
walls.  He sat in the chair she indicated and took the bottle of
mineral water she handed him.  "What are you going to do now that
the competition is over?" he asked after she sat down across from
him.
 
 She held out each boot for him to pull off as he knelt at
her feet unbidden.  Tara watched him with growing interest as he
removed each boot and placed them beside her desk.  "I thought I
would try relaxing a bit.  Do a bit of breaking."
 
 Brad sat back down and sipped his water with a puzzled
frown.  "I didn't know you had any new horses."
 
 Tara's eyes sparkled as she spoke, "Well, I got a new
stud a few weeks ago."
 
 "Can I be of any help?"
 
 "Oh, I think so."  She smiled over her bottle.  "In fact,
I think that you'll be indispensable.  That is if you agree to
it."
 
 Brad leaned forward in his chair eagerly.  "I'll do
anything you ask."
 
 "Good," she laid her bottle down on her desk and pointed
to another door in the office other than the one they had entered
through.  "I do my breaking in there.  Would you like to see?"
 
 "Yes."  He stood up, emptied his bottle and followed her
to the door.  His eyes met hers as she opened the door, and
somewhere deep inside him the words bubbled up.  "I'd do anything
for you, mistress."
 
 Tara stepped back hesitantly from the door at his words.
"No one's ever said that to me."
 
 Brad frowned again as he followed her into the room.  He
looked around at the dungeon, equipped with some of the best
instruments of pain and pleasure he had ever experienced either
by choice or by rape while trying to survive on the city streets.
A few of the devices were unfamiliar to him.  "I can't believe
that no one has ever submitted totally to you."
 
 "Well, to be honest," Tara said, sitting on a bench in
the center of the room, "I've never brought anyone in here be-
fore."
 
 "Really?" he asked as he examined the equipment more
closely.
 
 I've been buying stuff and reading stuff about SexMagick
for the past four years but have never had anyone to try it
with."  She blushed as she confessed to him, "I saw the things
that Kara was doing so I snuck in her room and read her magazines
and books.  But I think she's just into pain so she probably
doesn't have any of this stuff."
 
 Brad examined a familiar piece of nasty equipment.  "She
has some of this stuff."
 
 "Oh."  Tara rose to see what he examined.  "Yes, I didn't
think these looked to pleasurable."
 
 He set the thumbscrews down.  "No.  These can break
bones."
 
 "My purpose isn't to break bones, it's to break you," she
said with a grin.
 
 Brad felt his face grow a little warm at her intention.
He wondered if she were even eighteen years old like himself, not
of course that it mattered since she owned him now.  "All right.
But it won't be very hard to do."
 
 Tara frowned and gripped his dirty shirt collar tightly.
"I want it to be a challenge.  I want to break you just like I
break my horses so we operate as one under my command.  Do you
want to do this?" she asked, releasing one of her hands and
letting it slide down to his hard groin.
 
 "Yes.  I may have come here to escape the streets, but I
do enjoy pleasing a woman."  He bent his head so his tongue could
gently touch the hand that still gripped his collar.  "Just tell
me what you want, mistress."
 
 First, don't just give in to me.  Fight me a bit.  Sec-
ond, promise not to call me mistress until you feel compelled to,
forced to do so.  Don't submit until you're broke."  She released
him and stepped back.  "It will be better for both parties.
Breaking always makes it better for both parties.  Do you agree
to try it my way?"
 
 "Yes."

 Brad watched as Tara clamped his hands into the hanging
shackles.  He looked down at his clamped feet, spread two feet
apart.  Finally he examined the marks on his upper arms and chest
left by her lasso with which she had forced him into the feet
clamps.  "You're very strong," he commented.
 
 "Shut up!"  Tara stepped away from him and smiled as
wickedly as she could, which was difficult to do with the rising
excitement she felt at his half naked, restrained body.  She
feigned disinterest as she took a long, thin leather whip from
her collection.  She returned to her captive and ran the lash
between her fingers so he could see how long it was.  "This is
the finest leather that money can buy.  All of my toys are the
finest money can buy."
 
 Brad simply nodded silently, determined to give her the
fight she wanted.  But when she struck the wooden whipping bench
and chips flew, he had to admit to himself that she knew her
equipment and how to use it.  At least theoretically.
 
 Tara walked up and threw her arms around his neck so the
lash lay lazily over his shoulder.  She wasn't much shorter than
he, so she easily kissed him.
 
 He jumped from the sudden pain her quick downward snap of
the lash over his shoulder brought, but couldn't pull away from
her kiss because her other  hand gripped the back of his neck.
He moaned breathlessly when she released him.  He turned his head
as much as he could, keeping her in view as she walked slowly
around him.  He noticed with a bit of awe that the lash mark on
his shoulder hadn't drawn blood.
 
 "From my reading and observations of Kara's activities, I
believe that for most people pain doesn't bring pleasure and for
those it does, it is a specific type of pain.  A bit of sensuali-
ty can also push the border between pain and pleasure."  She
stood in front of him, laid the whip down on the floor in one
fluid movement, then started to unbraid her hair.  She ran her
fingers through the dark red strands and shook it out so it fell
over her shoulders to her waist.
 
 Brad felt a drop of sweat slide down his neck as she
approached again.  This time he held his breath as she picked up
the whip and walked behind him.  When the lash came he jumped in
surprise as her hair struck his entire back.  He turned his head
but was forced to look forward again by her hand.  She laughed
softly and released his face.  The real lash cut through his
jeans right underneath his left cheek.

 Tara took a deep breath and wiped the sweat from her brow
as she examined the limp naked body of her stud.  Well, it was
all limp except for one area which stood out.  She smiled as she
unbuttoned her shirt and let it fall to the floor.
 
 Brad looked at his torn jeans and underpants that she had
whipped and used her pocket knife to remove from him.  He looked
up at her and swallowed at the sight of her sweaty breasts cov-
ered only by her sports bra.  Unconsciously he thrust his pelvis
out as she approached.
 
 Tara smiled slyly at his feeble movement and placed her
arms around his neck.  She didn't even need to hold his head in
place as she kissed him.  "How do you feel, Brad?"
 
 He glanced downward and muttered, "Please?"
 
 She looked down at his hot and throbbing penis then back
at his face.  "Oh.  I know what you want."  She gently ran one
finger up the hot shaft and smiled as he closed his eyes and
moaned louder.  "But you don't get that until you're broken."
 
 Brad sighed miserably as she reached up to release his
hands.  He slumped forward into her waiting arms and let her lay
him on the floor at her feet.  He glanced at the key she dropped
on the floor in front of his face then up at her.
 
 Tara took two of the terry cloth towels she kept in the
room and threw him one.  "Release yourself and get ready for
dinner.  It's in one hour."  She smiled and folded her arms over
her chest just as she had when she had examined him in the stable
three weeks earlier.  "Scene over.  That was great!  Don't worry
about the clothes.  I'll buy you new ones."
 
 Brad released his ankles and stood carefully up, grabbing
one of the hanging shackles for support.  "You're very good."  He
glanced at his erect penis.  "Do you still want me to fight you?"
 
 She nodded.  "We haven't even begun."  She grabbed her
shirt and headed for the door.  "Your dinner clothes are in the
office closet."  Pausing at the door, she glanced back over her
shoulder.  "Don't tell anyone about this.  They'd be disillu-
sioned about their baby."

 Tara smiled as the wheel slowed and brought her captive
face to face with her.  She adjusted her tan push-up bra and her
western hat so that when his eyes focused they would find her
irresistible.  This was their second day in the dungeon and she
thought that he was close to breaking.  "Too soon," she whispered
as he raised his head up to squint at her.
 
 Brad smiled slightly as his eyes focused on his mistress.
His smile faded as she frowned down at him.  He laid his head
back down and lowered his eyes.  As he was about to speak, she
lifted his head up by the chin using the lariat she had ambushed
and hogtied him with two hours ago.
 
 "Did you want to say something, stud?" she asked, leaning
over him so her breasts just touched his chest.
 
 Brad's eyes opened wide and met hers before dropping
again.  He swallowed the rising heat the sight of her breasts
triggered in him.  "Yes, mis...."
 
 Tara clamped her hand over his mouth with a grin.  "No.
You don't get off that easy."  She cut the ropes that held his
hands and feet to the wheel.  "Maybe tomorrow, Brad."
 
 Brad stood up after she stepped back and put her shirt
back on.  He steadied himself with one hand on the wheel.
"Thanks," he said when Tara caught him as the wheel turned.
 
 "Scene over," she laughed.  She led him to the whipping
bench so he could sit for a second.  "How am I doing?"
 
 Brad looked up at her with a shake of his still dizzy
head.  "Wonderful.  Why did you stop me?"
 
 Tara shrugged.  "Tomorrow you'll break.  I just want this
to last.  It's fun," she added with a slight blush.
 
 "It doesn't have to end."  He knelt down at her feet and
pulled her down so she straddled him.  Their eyes locked as he
continued, "It can get better after I submit.  I've already
submitted totally in my heart."
 
 Tara pulled away gently but remained crouched in front of
him.  She glanced up and down his sweaty, bruised and bloodied
body that obviously wanted her in every way.  "Are you sure you
want an intimate relationship with me?"  She looked around the
dungeon warily.  "Are you sure you want this kind of intimacy
part of the time?"
 
 "I like it when you control me."  He leaned forward,
picked up her hand and licked it once with his eyes focused on
hers.  "I'm ready, mistress."
 
 Tara pushed him to the floor on his back.  Her eyes
blazed with desire as she tore off her shirt, bra and bikini
briefs.  She placed one hand on his chest, keeping the other
hidden behind her back, as she knelt over his groin, which he
kept respectfully on the floor.  "I want you right now, Brad."
 
 "His fingers dug into the dirt as he spoke shakily.
"What about dinner, mistress?"
 
 "I'm your dinner now, boy!" she exclaimed, whipping her
hand out from behind her back and slipping the cockring onto his
throbbing shaft.  Ignoring his moan, she moved up his torso so
her breasts were directly over his face.  "Let's see if your
tongue is as good in other areas as it was on my hand."  Brad
eagerly lifted his head, but she pushed him down.  "Not until I
say so."  She leaned closer to his trembling lips with a smile.
"Begin."
 
 Brad lightly licked each nipple, then increased his tempo
until she closed her eyes and pulled away.  He smiled as she
moved up his body to straddle his mouth.  He waited for her
command, then gently touched her clitoris, already slightly
engorged by her excitement.
 
 Tara jumped up as the new sensation shot through her
body.  "No.  Keep going," she whispered, lowering herself back
down.  She arched her back as his caressing brought her to
breathless pants.  As his tempo increased, she pushed farther
into his mouth and leaned over his head to grab his wrists as he
tried to touch her breasts.  "No," she muttered, pressing more of
her weight on his wrists.
 
 As the oxygen supply disappeared, Brad increased his
tempo and pressure on her hot, hard clit.  Finally, with a loud
moan she came and moved off his face to sit back on his chest.
He licked her juices from his mouth and chin.  Blinking to clear
his vision, he heard her demand for more.  "Please, mistress," he
begged both for her to stop and continue, his body torn between
desire and exhaustion.  She slipped down his body to straddle his
penis.  He jumped from the pain her riding crop caused as it
struck his nipples.
 
 "Now!"  She pulled the cockring off and pushed herself on
his stiff, red member.  Tara laughed at his helpless, pleading
cry.  "For each slash, you thrust," she instructed him with a
light whack of her riding crop, which caused him to thrust deep.
 
 Slowly, as the tempo of her slashing and the tempo of his
thrust synchronized, their moaning became one.  Together their
moans became soft cries of pleasure as she dropped the riding
crop and their fingers entwined.  Both backs arched, and two
identical screams shook the dungeon as they reached climax to-
gether.
 
 Tara collapsed on top of Brad and wrapped her arms around
him.  She smiled at him, blinking to keep the sweat from her
eyes.  "Hey!  If the first time is bad, I can't wait for the
second!"
 
 Brad glanced down at the blood covering his genitals and
hers.  "Mistress," he looked back into her eyes in surprise.  "I
didn't realize that it was your first time."
 
 Tara kissed him suddenly, then released him and stood up.
"It was great and I assure you that it will not be my last time."
She held out her hand and helped him up.  "You see, I told you it
would be better after you broke."
 
 Brad nodded as he caught the towel she threw him.  "I
think it was the best I've ever had, mistress."
 
 She smiled shyly at the title.  "I know you've had a hard
life, Brad.  But that's going to change...at least for most of
the time," she said, swinging one of the hanging shackles toward
him.
 
 Brad moved to catch her up in a hug.  "I'm glad," he
said, licking her neck once before following her from the dungeon
to the showers.

 "You sound like a broken record, Kara," Mara said with
ill hidden disgust.
 
 "Why?  What's your complaint now?" Tara asked as she and
Brad entered the dining room.
 
 "Same as always," Mara replied with a nod at the young
man kneeling at their elder sister's feet.
 
 Kara frowned as her former pet sat down in a chair next
to her youngest sister.  "Aren't you going to scold them,
mother?"
 
 Mrs. Sanwick smiled at the latecomers, then frowned at
her eldest daughter.  "Your sister is always late to meals during
the breaking season.  She has a good excuse but you do not!"
 
 Tara glanced at her family as she took some mashed pota-
toes and handed the bowl to Brad.  After a moment of harsh si-
lence she decided to explain herself.  "I finished the breaking
today."
 
 "In two days?"  Mrs. Sanwick asked politely.
 
 "Well, I only had one new stud to break this season."
She smiled at Brad who nodded in agreement to both meanings of
her statement.
 
 Kara guffawed once at her sister.  "If it takes you two
days to break a horse how long would it take you to break a man?
Two years?"
 
 Tara was about to reply when her mother spoke.  "I won't
have insults flung around this dinner table!  I consider myself
to be a very liberal woman and I tolerate your different tasted
in all areas of your life," Mrs. Sanwick said, glancing at each
person at the table.  "But I am setting down these rules.  Every
couple in this room will either remain a couple or move off this
ranch!"
 
 "No!" Kara said, rising to her feet.
 
 "Either sit down or leave!" Mrs. Sanwick replied coldly.
Everyone remained still until Kara sat back down.  "You would do
well to learn from your sisters' examples," their mother suggest-
ed sternly.
 
 "I could introduce you to some of my friends and take you
to some of our favorite hangouts," Mara said with a grin.
 
 "No, thank you," Kara replied with venom.
 
 "You could come out to the stable and learn something
from me and Brad," Tara offered with a twinkle in her eyes.
 
 "I'd rather die!"
 
 Tara turned to her companion and mouthed, "Good."
 
 Brad placed his hand over hers and gave it a warm squeeze
as he remembered their two days of breaking and looked forward to
many more seasons.
